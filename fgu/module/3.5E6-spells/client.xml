The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall.

If the transgression was intentional, the casting cleric must expend 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings for her god's intercession.</p><p><i>Redemption or Temptation:</i> You may cast this spell upon a creature of an opposing alignment in order to offer it a chance to change its alignment to match yours. The prospective subject must be present for the entire casting process. Upon completion of the spell, the subject freely chooses whether it retains its original alignment or acquiesces to your offer and changes to your alignment.

			<description type="formattedtext"><p>You "blink" quickly back and forth between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. You look as though you're winking in and out of reality at random. <i>Blinking</i> has several effects, as follows.</p><p>Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely invisible. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment).</p><p>If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.</p><p>Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're <i>blinking</i> unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane.</p><p>While <i>blinking</i>, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). Although you are only partially visible, you are not considered invisible and targets retain their Dexterity bonus to AC against your attacks. You do receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls made against enemies that cannot see invisible creatures.</p><p>You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.</p><p>While <i>blinking</i>, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled.</p><p>Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.</p><p>An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.</p><p>An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.</p><p>Force effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can't attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material.</p></description>

Creatures so affected cannot take violent actions (although they can defend themselves) or do anything destructive. Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed creature immediately breaks the spell on all calmed creatures.</p><p>This spell automatically suppresses (but does not dispel) any morale bonuses granted by spells such as <i>bless, good hope,</i> and <i>rage,</i> as well as negating a bard's ability to inspire courage or a barbarian's rage ability. It also suppresses any fear effects and removes the <i>confused</i> condition from all targets. While the spell lasts, a suppressed spell or effect has no effect. When the <i>calm emotions</i> spell ends, the original spell or effect takes hold of the creature again, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.</p></description>

When you plant the end of the staff in the ground and speak a special command to conclude the casting of the spell, your staff turns into a creature that looks and fights just like a treant. The staff-treant defends you and obeys any spoken commands. However, it is by no means a true treant; it cannot converse with actual treants or control trees. If the staff-treant is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it crumbles to powder and the staff is destroyed. Otherwise, the staff returns to its normal form when the spell duration expires (or when the spell is dismissed), and it can be used as the focus for another casting of the spell. The staff-treant is always at full strength when created, despite any wounds it may have incurred the last time it appeared.</p></description>

			<description type="formattedtext"><p>You can use <i>dispel magic</i> to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by <i>dispel magic</i>. <i>Dispel magic</i> can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the <i>dispel magic</i> can take effect.</p><p>You choose to use <i>dispel magic</i> in one of three ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell:</p><p><i>Targeted Dispel:</i> One object, creature, or spell is the target of the <i>dispel magic</i> spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.</p><p>For example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel magic, targeting a creature affected by <i>stoneskin</i> (caster level 12th) and <i>fly</i> (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the <i>stoneskin</i> (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the <i>fly</i> (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the <i>stoneskin</i> would have been dispelled, leaving the <i>fly</i> intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.</p><p>You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.</p><p>If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by <i>summon monster</i>), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.</p><p>If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.</p><p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.</p><p><i>Counterspell:</i> When <i>dispel magic</i> is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, <i>dispel magic</i> may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.</p></description>

The DC of this check is equal to the curse's DC.</p><p><i>Area Dispel</i>: When <i>greater dispel magic</i> is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Roll one dispel check and apply that check to each creature in the area, as if targeted by <i>dispel magic</i>. For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, apply the dispel check as with creatures.

For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the <i>greater dispel magic</i> spell, apply the dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.</p><p>If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by <i>summon monster</i>) is in the area, apply the dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel one spell targeting the creature or object.</p><p>You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.</p><p><i>Counterspell</i>: This functions as <i>dispel magic</i>, but you receive a +4 bonus on your dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.</p><linklist><link class="spelldesc" recordname="spelldesc.dispelmagic@3.5E6 Spells">Dispel Magic</link></linklist></description>

The powerful shockwave created by this spell knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack. A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an <i>earthquake</i> spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.</p><p><i>Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel:</i> The roof collapses, dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half ) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An <i>earthquake</i> cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.</p><p><i>Cliffs: Earthquake</i> causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).</p><p><i>Open Ground:</i> Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 40 feet deep. At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut. Treat all trapped creatures as if they were in the bury zone of an avalanche, trapped without air</p><p><i>Structure:</i> Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).</p><p><i>River, Lake, or Marsh:</i> Fissures open underneath the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.</p><p><i>Pinned beneath Rubble:</i> Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.</p></description>

The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first. <i>Find the path</i> can be used to remove the subject and its companions from the effect of a <i>maze</i> spell in a single round, specifying the destination as "outside the <i>maze</i>." This divination is keyed to the recipient, not its companions, and its effect does not predict or allow for the actions of creatures (including guardians) who might take action to oppose the caster as he follows the path revealed by this spell.</p></description>

If it has a touch spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when the <i>gaseous form</i> spell takes effect.</p><p>A gaseous creature can't run, but it can fly at a speed of 10 feet and automatically succeeds on all Fly skill checks. It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all it was wearing or holding in its hands, as long as the spell persists. The creature is subject to the effects of wind, and it can't enter water or other liquid. It also can't manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along with its gaseous form. Continuously active items remain active, though in some cases their effects may be moot.</p></description>

			<description type="formattedtext"><p>This powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or object. A <i>glyph of warding</i> can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on.</p><p>You set the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores. Alternatively or in addition to a password trigger, glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature type, subtype, or kind. Glyphs can also be set with respect to good, evil, law, or chaos, or to pass those of your religion. They cannot be set according to class, HD, or level. Glyphs respond to invisible creatures normally but are not triggered by those who travel past them ethereally. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area. However, if a cabinet has three drawers, each can be separately warded.</p><p>When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. A glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery become nearly invisible.</p><p>Glyphs cannot be affected or bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled. <i>Mislead</i>, <i>polymorph</i>, and <i>nondetection</i> (and similar magical effects) can fool a glyph, though nonmagical disguises and the like can't. <i>Read magic</i> allows you to identify a <i>glyph of warding</i> with a DC 13 Knowledge (arcana) check. Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and allows you to know the basic nature of the glyph (version, type of damage caused, what spell is stored).</p><p><i>Note:</i> Magic traps such as <i>glyph of warding</i> are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find the glyph and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 28 for <i>glyph of warding</i>.</p><p>Depending on the version selected, a glyph either blasts the intruder or activates a spell.</p><p><i>Blast Glyph:</i> A <i>blast glyph</i> deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the intruder and to all within 5 feet of him or her. This damage is acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic (caster's choice, made at time of casting). Each creature affected can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage. Spell resistance applies against this effect.</p><p><i>Spell Glyph:</i> You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your caster level at the time of casting the glyph. If the spell has a target, it targets the intruder. If the spell has an area or an amorphous effect the area or effect is centered on the intruder. If the spell summons creatures, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack. Saving throws and spell resistance operate as normal, except that the DC is based on the level of the spell stored in the glyph.</p></description>

Spell resistance does not apply to this effect.

At the end of the year, the chosen effect lapses, but it can be renewed or replaced simply by casting <i>hallow</i> again.</p><p>Spell effects that may be tied to a <i>hallowed</i> site include <i>aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, death ward, deeper darkness, detect evil, detect magic, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement, invisibility purge, protection from energy, remove fear, resist energy, silence, tongues,</i> and <i>zone of truth</i>.

If the subject chooses not to follow, the hand continues to beckon for the duration of the spell, then disappears. If the spell expires while the subject is en route to you, the hand disappears; the subject must then rely on her own devices to locate you.</p><p>If more than one subject in a 5-mile radius meets the description, the hand locates the closest creature. If that creature refuses to follow the hand, the hand does not seek out a second subject.</p><p>If, at the end of 4 hours of searching, the hand has found no subject that matches the description within 5 miles, it returns to you, displays an outstretched palm (indicating that no such creature was found), and disappears.</p><p>The ghostly hand has no physical form.

The hand can't pass through solid objects but can ooze through small cracks and slits. The hand cannot travel more than 5 miles from the spot it appeared when you cast the spell.</p></description>

			<description type="formattedtext"><p>The creature or object touched becomes invisible. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.</p><p>Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.</p><p>Of course, the subject is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as swimming in water or stepping in a puddle). If a check is required, a stationary invisible creature has a +40 bonus on its Stealth checks. This bonus is reduced to +20 if the creature is moving. The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character's perceptions. Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as bless that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.</p><p><i>Invisibility</i> can be made permanent (on objects only) with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p></description>

			<description type="formattedtext"><p>All creatures within the area gain the effects of a <i>protection from evil</i> spell, and evil summoned creatures cannot enter the area either. Creatures in the area, or who later enter the area, receive only one attempt to suppress effects that are controlling them. If successful, such effects are suppressed as long as they remain in the area. Creatures that leave the area and come back are not protected.You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of <i>protection from evil</i>), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance.</p><p>This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A <i>magic circle against evil</i> can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the <i>lesser planar binding, planar binding,</i> and <i>greater planar binding</i> spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the <i>magic circle</i>. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal <i>protection from evil</i> spell for that creature only.</p><p>A <i>magic circle</i> leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (<i>astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport,</i> and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a <i>dimensional anchor</i> spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the <i>anchor</i> effect lasts as long as the <i>magic circle</i> does. The creature cannot reach across the <i>magic circle,</i> but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.</p><p>You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the <i>magic circle</i> more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.</p><p>A successful diagram allows you to cast a <i>dimensional anchor</i> spell on the <i>magic circle</i> during the round before casting any summoning spell. The <i>anchor</i> holds any called creatures in the <i>magic circle</i> for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a <i>magic circle</i> prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the <i>lesser planar binding</i> spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram - even a straw laid across it. However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.</p><p>This spell is not cumulative with <i>protection from evil</i> and vice versa.</p></description>

			<description type="formattedtext"><p>By casting <i>magic jar,</i> you place your soul in a gem or large crystal (known as the <i>magic jar</i>), leaving your body lifeless. Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the <i>magic jar.</i> You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body. The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty. To cast the spell, the <i>magic jar</i> must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead.</p><p>While in the <i>magic jar,</i> you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence). You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more HD between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.)</p><p>You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.</p><p>Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by <i>protection from evil</i> or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the <i>magic jar</i> unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the <i>magic jar,</i> and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.</p><p>If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the <i>magic jar.</i> You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.</p><p>As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the <i>magic jar</i> if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.</p><p>If the host body is slain, you return to the <i>magic jar,</i> if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.</p><p>If the spell ends while you are in the <i>magic jar,</i> you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the <i>magic jar</i> returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the <i>magic jar</i> or at the host's location.</p></description>

The message, which must be 25 or fewer words long, can be in any language known by you and can be delivered over a period of 10 minutes. The mouth cannot utter verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Of course, <i>magic mouth</i> can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object or creature.</p><p>The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical <i>darkness</i> or <i>invisibility</i> does. Silent movement or magical <i>silence</i> defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A <i>magic mouth</i> cannot distinguish alignment, level, HD, or class except by external garb.</p><p>The range limit of a trigger is 15 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a <i>magic mouth</i> to respond to triggers as far as 90 feet away. Regardless of range, the mouth can respond only to visible or audible triggers and actions in line of sight or within hearing distance.</p><p><i>Magic mouth</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p></description>

Minor physical damage to the stone does not harm you, but its partial destruction (to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. The stone's complete destruction expels you and slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save. Even if you make your save, you still take 5d6 points of damage.</p><p>Any time before the duration expires, you can step out of the stone through the surface that you entered. If the spell's duration expires or the effect is dispelled before you voluntarily exit the stone, you are violently expelled and take 5d6 points of damage.</p><p>The following spells harm you if cast upon the stone that you are occupying: <i>Stone to flesh</i> expels you and deals you 5d6 points of damage. <i>Stone shape</i> deals you 3d6 points of damage but does not expel you. <i>Transmute rock to mud</i> expels you and then slays you instantly unless you make a DC 18 Fortitude save, in which case you are merely expelled.

If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual creature's name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway).</p><p>You may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you. Tasks might range from the simple to the complex. You must be able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain for its services.</p><p>The creature called requires a payment for its services. This payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches the creature's alignment and goals. Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.</p><p>A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A long-term task, one requiring up to one day per caster level, requires a payment of 1,000 gp per HD.</p><p>A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (remember, a called creature actually dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature). However, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature's ethos, it may halve or even waive the payment.</p><p>At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for expires, the creature returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if appropriate and possible).</p><p><i>Note:</i> When you use a calling spell that calls an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.</p></description>

			<description type="formattedtext"><p>Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a creature from another plane to a specifically prepared trap, which must lie within the spell's range. The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.</p><p>To create the trap, you must use a <i>magic circle</i> spell, focused inward. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell.</p><p>The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap with by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Cha modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A <i>dimensional anchor</i> cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see <i>magic circle against evil</i>) to make the trap more secure.</p><p>If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to.

It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. <i>Prestidigitation</i> can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a <i>prestidigitation</i> spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, a <i>prestidigitation</i> lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects.

			<description type="formattedtext"><p>This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.</p><p>First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.</p><p>Second, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment [charm] effects and enchantment [compulsion] effects). This saving throw is made with a +2 morale bonus, using the same DC as the original effect. If successful, such effects are suppressed for the duration of this spell. The effects resume when the duration of this spell expires. While under the effects of this spell, the target is immune to any new attempts to possess or exercise mental control over the target. This spell does not expel a controlling life force (such as a ghost or spellcaster using magic jar), but it does prevent them from controlling the target. This second effect only functions against spells and effects created by evil creatures or objects, subject to GM discretion.</p><p>Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by evil summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Summoned creatures that are not evil are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.</p></description>

A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being raised. A spellcasting creature that doesn't prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.</p><p>A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current HD. Any ability scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead creature's equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this spell.</p><p>A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be raised by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.</p></description>

			<description type="formattedtext"><p>With this spell, you bring back a dead creature in another body, provided that its death occurred no more than 1 week before the casting of the spell and the subject's soul is free and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.</p><p>Since the dead creature is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated.</p><p>A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class abilities, feats, or skill ranks it formerly possessed. Its class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points are unchanged. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores depend partly on the new body. First eliminate the subject's racial adjustments (since it is no longer necessarily of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject of the spell gains two permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be reincarnated). A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being reincarnated. A spellcasting creature that doesn't prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.</p><p>It's possible for the change in the subject's ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class. If this is the case, the subject is advised to become a multiclass character.</p><p>For a humanoid creature, the new incarnation is determined using the table on the next page. For nonhumanoid creatures, a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created.</p><p>A creature that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can't be reincarnated. The spell can bring back a creature that has died of old age.</p><table> <tr decoration="underline"> <td> <b>d%</b> </td> <td colspan="2"> <b>Incarnation</b> </td> <td> <b>Str</b> </td> <td> <b>Dex</b> </td> <td> <b>Con</b> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 01 </td> <td colspan="2"> Bugbear </td> <td> +4 </td> <td> +2 </td> <td> +2 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 02-13 </td> <td colspan="2"> Dwarf </td> <td> +0 </td> <td> +0 </td> <td> +2 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 14-25 </td> <td colspan="2"> Elf </td> <td> +0 </td> <td> +2 </td> <td> -2 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 26 </td> <td colspan="2"> Gnoll </td> <td> +4 </td> <td> +0 </td> <td> +2 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 27-38 </td> <td colspan="2"> Gnome </td> <td> -2 </td> <td> +0 </td> <td> +2 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 39-42 </td> <td colspan="2"> Goblin </td> <td> -2 </td> <td> +2 </td> <td> +0 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 43-52 </td> <td colspan="2"> Half-elf </td> <td> +0 </td> <td> +2 </td> <td> +0 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 53-62 </td> <td colspan="2"> Half-orc </td> <td> +2 </td> <td> +0 </td> <td> +0 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 63-74 </td> <td colspan="2"> Halfling </td> <td> -2 </td> <td> +2 </td> <td> +0 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 75-89 </td> <td colspan="2"> Human </td> <td> +0 </td> <td> +0 </td> <td> +0 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 90-93 </td> <td colspan="2"> Kobold </td> <td> -4 </td> <td> +2 </td> <td> -2 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 94 </td> <td colspan="2"> Lizardfolk </td> <td> +2 </td> <td> +0 </td> <td> +2 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 95-98 </td> <td colspan="2"> Orc </td> <td> +4 </td> <td> +0 </td> <td> +0 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 99 </td> <td colspan="2"> Troglodyte </td> <td> +0 </td> <td> -2 </td> <td> +4 </td> </tr> <tr> <td> 100 </td> <td colspan="2"> Other (GM's choice) </td> <td> ? </td> <td> ? </td> <td> ? </td> </tr> </table><p>The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesn't automatically speak the language of the new form.</p><p>A <i>wish</i> or a <i>miracle</i> spell can restore a reincarnated character to his or her original form.</p></description>

			<description type="formattedtext"><p>To use the <i>shadow walk</i> spell, you must be in an area of dim light. You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other.</p><p>In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.</p><p>Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10  100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10  1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save).</p><p><i>Shadow walk</i> can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours.</p><p>Any creatures touched by you when <i>shadow walk</i> is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow.</p><p>They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful.</p></description>

			<description type="formattedtext"><p>This spell enables you to make a snare that functions as a magic trap. The snare can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When you cast <i>snare</i> upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings (DC 23 Perception check for a character with the trapfinding ability to locate). One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle.</p><p>If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend and then straighten when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens around the creature, dealing no damage but causing it to be entangled.</p><p>The snare is magical. To escape, a trapped creature must make a DC 23 Escape Artist check or a DC 23 Strength check that is a full-round action. The snare has AC 7 and 5 hit points. A successful escape from the snare breaks the loop and ends the spell.</p></description>

			<description type="formattedtext"><p>weapon made of force appears and attacks foes at a distance, as you direct it, dealing 1d8 force damage per hit, + 1 point per three caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the reduction in damage associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.</p><p>Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the <i>spiritual weapon</i> is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.</p><p>A <i>spiritual weapon</i> cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of cancellation</i> affects it. A <i>spiritual weapon</i>'s AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object).</p><p>If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the <i>spiritual weapon</i> strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.</p><p>The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity's own personal weapon.

Creatures on the accompanying Summon Monster table marked with an "*" are summoned with the celestial template, if you are good, and the fiendish template, if you are evil.

			<description type="formattedtext"><p>You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force, perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent thrust.</p><p><i>Sustained Force:</i> A sustained force moves an object weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell resistance.</p><p>This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically, horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.</p><p>An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require DC 15 Intelligence checks.</p><p><i>Combat Maneuver:</i> Alternatively, once per round, you can use <i>telekinesis</i> to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip. Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and you use your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.</p><p><i>Violent Thrust:</i> Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).</p><p>You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense objects). Objects and creatures that miss their target land in a square adjacent to the target.</p><p>Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell.</p><p>If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).</p></description>

You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as four Medium creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with you.

Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.</p><p>You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.</p><p>To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table.

"Studied carefully" is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it or you've been there often.

"Viewed once" is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic such as <i>scrying</i>.</p><p>"False destination" is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.</p><p><i>On Target:</i> You appear where you want to be.</p><p><i>Off Target:</i> You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly</p><p><i>Similar Area:</i> You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead.</p><p><i>Mishap:</i> You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten "scrambled." You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80.

It can't perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can't be used untrained.

The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level.

The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object.</p><p>Unlike a <i>wall of iron,</i> you can create a <i>wall of stone</i> in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell's area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.</p><p>Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a <i>disintegrate</i> spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping.

Any creature forced into or attempting to move through a <i>wall of thorns</i> takes slashing damage per round of movement equal to 25 minus the creature's AC. Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation. (Creatures with an AC of 25 or higher, without considering Dexterity and dodge bonuses, take no damage from contact with the wall.)</p><p>You can make the wall as thin as 5 feet thick, which allows you to shape the wall as a number of 10-by-10-by-5-foot blocks equal to twice your caster level. This has no effect on the damage dealt by the thorns, but any creature attempting to break through takes that much less time to force its way through the barrier.</p><p>Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds 20, a creature moves 5 feet (up to a maximum distance equal to its normal land speed). Of course, moving or attempting to move through the thorns incurs damage as described above. A creature trapped in the thorns can choose to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage.</p><p>Any creature within the area of the spell when it is cast takes damage as if it had moved into the wall and is caught inside. In order to escape, it must attempt to push its way free, or it can wait until the spell ends. Creatures with the ability to pass through overgrown areas unhindered can pass through a <i>wall of thorns</i> at normal speed without taking damage.</p><p>A <i>wall of thorns</i> can be breached by slow work with edged weapons.

			<description type="formattedtext"><p>This spell creates a powerful cyclone of raging wind that moves through the air, along the ground, or over water at a speed of 60 feet per round. You can concentrate on controlling the cyclone's every movement or specify a simple program. Directing the cyclone's movement or changing its programmed movement is a standard action for you. The cyclone always moves during your turn. If the cyclone exceeds the spell's range, it moves in a random, uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds and then dissipates. (You can't regain control of the cyclone, even if comes back within range.)</p><p>Any Large or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect must succeed on a Reflex save or take 3d6 points of damage. A Medium or smaller creature that fails its first save must succeed on a second one or be picked up bodily by the cyclone and held suspended in its powerful winds, taking 1d8 points of damage each round on your turn with no save allowed. You may direct the cyclone to eject any carried creatures whenever you wish, depositing the hapless souls wherever the cyclone happens to be when they are released.</p></description>

The <i>whispering wind</i> travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location. A <i>whispering wind</i> is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates.</p><p>You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than 25 words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the <i>whispering wind</i> seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the <i>whispering wind</i> to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes.</p><p>When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in place until the message is delivered.

You can take other creatures with you, each of which acts independently.</p><p>Normally, a wind walker flies at a speed of 10 feet with perfect maneuverability. If desired by the subject, a magical wind wafts a <i>wind walker</i> along at up to 600 feet per round (60 mph) with poor maneuverability. Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are 80% likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, or the like.</p><p>A wind walker can regain its physical form as desired and later resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous form takes 5 rounds, which counts toward the duration of the spell (as does any time spent in physical form). As noted above, you can dismiss the spell, and you can even dismiss it for individual wind walkers and not others.</p><p>For the last minute of the spell's duration, a wind walker in cloud form automatically descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though it may descend faster if it wishes. This descent serves as a warning that the spell is about to end.</p></description>
