Friendly troops within 360 feet of the user become braver than normal.

					<p>This plate armor is fashioned to make the wearer appear to be a demon. The helmet is shaped to look like a horned demon head, and its wearer looks out of the open, tooth-filled mouth. This <i>+4 full plate</i> allows the wearer to make claw attacks that deal 1d10 points of damage, strike as +1 weapons, and afflict the target as if she had been struck by a <i>contagion</i> spell (Fortitude DC 14 negates). Use of <i>contagion</i> requires a normal melee attack with the claws. The 'claws' are built into the armor's vambraces and gauntlets, and cannot be disarmed.</p>
					<p>A suit of demon armor is infused with evil, and as a result it bestows one negative level on any nonevil creature wearing it. This negative level persists as long as the armor is worn and disappears when the armor is removed. The negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the armor is worn.</p>

					<p>This work bestows upon any character of any class the ability to use the spells within its pages. However, any character not already able to use spells gains one negative level for as long as the book is in her possession or while she uses its power.

Similarly, the spells cannot be cast as scroll spells, nor can they be copied into a spellbook-their magic is bound up permanently within the book itself.</p>
					<p>The owner of the book need not have the book on her person in order to use its power. The book can be stored in a place of safety while the owner is adventuring and still allow its owner to cast spells by means of its power.</p>

					<p>The Codex is enormous - supposedly, it requires two strong men to lift it. No matter how many pages are turned, another always remains. Anyone opening the Codex for the first time is utterly annihilated, as with a <i>destruction</i> spell (Fortitude DC 30). Those who survive can peruse its pages and learn its powers, though not without risk. Each day spent studying the Codex allows the reader to make a Spellcraft check (DC 50) to learn one of its powers (choose the power learned randomly; add a +1 circumstance bonus on the check per additional day spent reading until a power is learned). However, each day of study also forces the reader to make a Will save (DC 30 + 1 per day of study) to avoid being driven insane (as the <i>insanity</i> spell).</p>
					<p>The powers of the Codex of the Infinite Planes are as follows: astral projection, banishment, elemental swarm, gate, greater planar ally, greater planar binding, plane shift, and soul bind.</p>
					<p>Each of these spell-like abilities are usable at will by the owner of the Codex (assuming that he or she has learned how to access the power). The <i>Codex of the Infinite Planes</i> has a caster level of 30th for the purposes of all powers and catastrophes, and all saving throw DCs are 20 + spell level. Activating any power requires a Spellcraft check (DC 40 + twice the spell level of the power; the character can't take 10 on this check). Any failure on either check indicates that a catastrophe befalls the user (roll on the table below for the effect). A character can only incur one catastrophe per power use.</p>

				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>A <i>deck of many things</i> (both beneficial and baneful) is usually found in a box or leather pouch. Each deck contains a number of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with glyphs, characters, and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse.</p>
					<p>The character with a deck of many things who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw from this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own. If the Jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw two additional cards.</p>
					<p>Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless the draw is the Jester or the Fool, in which case the card is discarded from the pack. A deck of many things contains 22 cards. To simulate the magic cards, you may want to use tarot cards, as indicated in the second column of the accompanying table. If no tarot deck is available, substitute ordinary playing cards instead, as indicated in the third column. The effects of each card, summarized on the table, are fully described below.</p>

					</table>
					<p><i>Balance</i>: The character must change to a radically different alignment. If the character fails to act according to the new alignment, she gains a negative level.</p>
					<p><i>Comet</i>: The character must single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or monsters encountered, or the benefit is lost. If successful, the character gains enough XP to attain the next experience level.</p>
					<p><i>Donjon</i>: This card signifies imprisonment - either by the <i>imprisonment</i> spell or by some powerful being. All gear and spells are stripped from the victim in any case. Draw no more cards.</p>
					<p><i>Euryale</i>: The medusa-like visage of this card brings a curse that only the Fates card or a deity can remove. The -1 penalty on all saving throws is otherwise permanent.</p>
					<p><i>The Fates</i>: This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if so desired, for the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note that it does not enable something to happen. It can only stop something from happening or reverse a past occurrence. The reversal is only for the character who drew the card; other party members may have to endure the situation.</p>
					<p><i>Flames</i>: Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational forces for the enmity. The enmity of the outsider can't be ended until one of the parties has been slain. Determine the outsider randomly, and assume that it attacks the character (or plagues her life in some way) within 1d20 days.</p>
					<p><i>Fool</i>: The payment of XP and the redraw are mandatory. This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the <i>Jester</i>.</p>
					<p><i>Gem</i>: This card indicates wealth. The jewelry is all gold set with gems, each piece worth 2,000 gp, and the gems are worth 1,000 gp each.</p>
					<p><i>Idiot</i>: This card causes the drain of 1d4+1 points of Intelligence immediately. The additional draw is optional.</p>
					<p><i>Jester</i>: This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the <i>Fool</i>. The redraws are optional.</p>
					<p><i>Key</i>: The magic weapon granted must be one usable by the character. It suddenly appears out of nowhere in the character's hand.</p>
					<p><i>Knight</i>: The fighter appears out of nowhere and serves loyally until death. He or she is of the same race (or kind) and gender as the character. This fighter can be taken as a cohort by a character with the Leadership feat.</p>
					<p><i>Moon</i>: This card bears the image of a moonstone gem with the appropriate number of <i>wishes</i> shown as gleams therein; sometimes it depicts a moon with its phase indicating the number of <i>wishes</i> (full = four; gibbous = three; half = two; quarter = one). These <i>wishes</i> are the same as those granted by the 9th-level wizard spell and must be used within a number of minutes equal to the number received.</p>
					<p><i>Rogue</i>: When this card is drawn, one of the character's NPC friends (preferably a cohort) is totally alienated and made forever hostile. If the character has no cohorts, the enmity of some powerful personage (or community, or religious order) can be substituted. The hatred is secret until the time is ripe for it to be revealed with devastating effect.</p>
					<p><i>Ruin</i>: As implied by its name, when this card is drawn, all nonmagical possessions of the drawer are lost.</p>
					<p><i>Skull</i>: A dread wraith appears. The character must fight it alone- if others help, they get dread wraiths to fight as well. If the character is slain, she is slain forever and cannot be revived, even with a <i>wish</i> or a <i>miracle</i>.</p>
					<p><i>Star</i>: The 2 points are added to any ability the character chooses. They cannot be divided among two abilities.</p>
					<p><i>Sun</i>: Roll for a medium wondrous item until a useful item is indicated.</p><p><i>Talons</i>: When this card is drawn, every magic item owned or possessed by the character is instantly and irrevocably lost, except for the deck.</p>
					<p><i>Throne</i>: The character becomes a true leader in people's eyes. The castle gained appears in any open area she <i>wishes</i> (but the decision where to place it must be made within 1 hour).</p>
					<p><i>Vizier</i>: This card empowers the character drawing it with the one-time ability to call upon a source of wisdom to solve any single problem or answer fully any question upon her request. The query or request must be made within 1 year. Whether the information gained can be successfully acted upon is another matter entirely.</p>
					<p><i>The Void</i>: This black card spells instant disaster. The character's body continues to function, as though comatose, but her psyche is trapped in a prison somewhere-in an object on a far plane or planet, possibly in the possession of an outsider. A <i>wish</i> or a <i>miracle</i> does not bring the character back, instead merely revealing the plane of entrapment. Draw no more cards.</p>
					<h>Destruction</h>
					<p>The deck of many things can be destroyed by losing it in a wager with a deity of law. The deity must be unaware of the nature of the deck.</p>

				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>Each of these fabled orbs contains the essence and personality of an ancient dragon of a different variety (one for each of the major ten different chromatic and metallic dragons). The bearer of an <i>Orb</i> can, as a standard action, dominate dragons of its particular variety within 500 feet (as <i>dominate monster</i>), the dragon being forced to make a DC 25 Will save to resist. Spell resistance is not useful against this effect. Each <i>Orb of Dragonkind</i> bestows upon the wielder the AC and saving throw bonuses of the dragon within. These values replace whatever values the character would otherwise have, whether they are better or worse. These values cannot be modified by any means short of ridding the character of the <i>Orb</i>. A character possessing an <i>Orb of Dragonkind</i> is immune to the breath weapon - but only the breath weapon - of the dragon variety keyed to the <i>Orb</i>. Finally, a character possessing an <i>Orb</i> can herself use the breath weapon of the dragon in the <i>Orb</i> three times per day.</p>
					<p>All <i>Orbs of Dragonkind</i> can be used to communicate verbally and visually with the possessors of the other <i>Orbs</i>. The owner of an <i>Orb</i> knows if there are dragons within 10 miles at all times. For dragons of the <i>Orb</i>'s particular variety, the range is 100 miles. If within 1 mile of a dragon of the <i>Orb</i>'s variety, the wielder can determine the dragon's exact location and age. The bearer of one of these <i>Orbs</i> earns the enmity of dragonkind forever for profiting by draconic enslavement, even if she later loses the item. Each <i>Orb</i> also has an individual power that can be invoked once per round at caster level 10th.</p>
					<list>
						<li><i>Black Dragon Orb:</i> Fly.</li>
						<li><i>Blue Dragon Orb:</i> Haste.</li>
						<li><i>Brass Dragon Orb:</i> Teleport.</li>
						<li><i>Bronze Dragon Orb:</i> Scrying (Will DC 18 negates).</li>
						<li><i>Copper Dragon Orb:</i> Suggestion (Will DC 17 negates).</li>
						<li><i>Gold Dragon Orb:</i> The owner of the gold Orb can call upon any power possessed by one of the other Orbs-including the dominate and breath weapon abilities but not AC, save bonuses, or breath weapon immunity - but can only use an individual power once per day. She can dominate any other possessor of an Orb within 1 mile (Will DC 23 negates).</li>
						<li><i>Green Dragon Orb:</i> Spectral hand.</li>
						<li><i>Red Dragon Orb:</i> Wall of fire.</li>
						<li><i>Silver Dragon Orb:</i> Cure critical wounds (Will DC 18 half).</li>
						<li><i>White Dragon Orb:</i> Protection from energy (cold) (Fortitude DC 17 negates)</li>

				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>This rare substance appears to be an ordinary, sooty piece of blackish rock. If the stone is broken open (break DC 20), a cavity is revealed at the stone's heart. This cavity is lined with a magical type of quicksilver that enables any arcane spellcaster to transmute base metals (iron and lead) into silver and gold. A single <i>philosopher's stone</i> can turn from up to 5,000 pounds of iron into silver, or up to 1,000 pounds of lead into gold. However, the quicksilver becomes unstable once the stone is opened and loses its potency within 24 hours, so all transmutations must take place within that period.</p>
					<p>The quicksilver found in the center of the stone may also be put to another use. If mixed with any cure potion while the substance is still potent, it creates a special oil of life that acts as a <i>true resurrection</i> spell for any dead body it is sprinkled upon.</p>
					<h>Destruction</h>
					<p>The philosopher's stone can be destroyed by being placed in the heel of a titan's boot for at least 1 entire week.</p>

				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>This artifact was crafted centuries ago, weaving together the wispy strands of shadow itself into a twisted black staff. The <i>Shadowstaff</i> makes the wielder slightly shadowy and incorporeal, granting him a +4 bonus to AC and Reflex saves (which stacks with any other bonuses). However, in bright light (such as that of the sun, but not a torch) or in absolute darkness, the wielder takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and checks. The <i>Shadowstaff</i> also has these powers.</p>
					<list>
						<li><i>Summon Shadows:</i> Three times per day the staff may summon 2d4 shadows. Immune to turning, they serve the wielder as if called by a summon monster V spell cast at 20th level.</li>
						<li><i>Summon Nightshade:</i> Once per month, the staff can summon an advanced shadow demon that serves the wielder as if called by a summon monster IX spell cast at 20th level.</li>
						<li><i>Shadow Form:</i> Three times per day the wielder can become a living shadow, with all the movement powers granted by gaseous form.</li>
						<li><i>Shadow Bolt:</i> Three times per day the staff can project a ray attack that deals 10d6 points of cold damage to a single target. The shadow bolt has a range of 100 feet.</li>

				<name type="string">Sphere of Annihilation</name>
				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>A <i>sphere of annihilation</i> is a globe of absolute blackness, a ball of nothingness 2 feet in diameter. The object is actually a hole in the continuity of the multiverse. Any matter that comes in contact with a sphere is instantly sucked into the void, gone, and utterly destroyed. Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore an annihilated character.</p>
					<p>A <i>sphere of annihilation</i> is static, resting in some spot as if it were a normal hole. It can be caused to move, however, by mental effort (think of this as a mundane form of <i>telekinesis</i>, too weak to move actual objects but a force to which the sphere, being weightless, is sensitive). A character's ability to gain control of a sphere of annihilation (or to keep controlling one) is based on the result of a control check against DC 30 (a move action). A control check is 1d20 + character level + character Int modifier. If the check succeeds, the character can move the sphere (perhaps to bring it into contact with an enemy) as a free action.</p>
					<p>Control of a sphere can be established from as far away as 40 feet (the character need not approach too closely). Once control is established, it must be maintained by continuing to make control checks (all DC 30) each round. For as long as a character maintains control (does not fail a check) in subsequent rounds, he can control the sphere from a distance of 40 feet + 10 feet per character level. The sphere's speed in a round is 10 feet + 5 feet for every 5 points by which the character's control check result in that round exceeded 30.</p>
					<p>If a control check fails, the sphere slides 10 feet in the direction of the character attempting to move it. If two or more creatures vie for control of a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, the rolls are opposed. If none are successful, the sphere slips toward the one who rolled lowest.</p>
					<p>See also <i>talisman of the sphere</i>.</p>
					<h>Destruction</h>
					<p>Should a <i>gate</i> spell be cast upon a sphere of annihilation, there is a 50% chance (01-50 on d%) that the spell destroys it, a 35% chance (51-85) that the spell does nothing, and a 15% chance (86-100) that a gap is torn in the spatial fabric, catapulting everything within a 180-foot radius into another plane. If a rod of cancellation touches a sphere of annihilation, they negate each other in a tremendous explosion. Everything within a 60-foot radius takes 2d6  10 points of damage. <i>Dispel magic</i> and <i>mage's disjunction</i> have no effect on a sphere.</p>

				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>A long wooden staff, shod in iron and inscribed with sigils and runes of all types, this potent artifact contains many spell powers and other functions. Unlike a normal staff, a staff of the magi holds 50 charges and cannot be recharged normally. Some of its powers use charges, while others don't. A staff of the magi does not lose its powers if it runs out of charges. The following powers do not use charges:</p>
					<list>
						<li>Detect magic</li>
						<li>Enlarge person (Fortitude DC 15 negates)</li>
						<li>Hold portal</li>
						<li>Light</li>
						<li>Mage armor</li>
						<li>Mage hand</li>
					</list>
					<p>The following powers drain 1 charge per usage:</p>
					<list>
						<li>Dispel magic</li>
						<li>Fireball (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half)</li>
						<li>Ice storm</li>
						<li>Invisibility</li>
						<li>Knock</li>
						<li>Lightning Bolt (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half)</li>
						<li>Passwall</li>
						<li>Pyrotechnics (Will or Fortitude DC 16 negates)</li>
						<li>Wall of fire</li>
						<li>Web</li>
					</list>
					<p>These powers drain 2 charges per usage:</p>
					<list>
						<li>Summon monster IX</li>
						<li>Plane shift (Will DC 21 negates)</li>
						<li>Telekinesis (400 lbs. maximum weight; Will DC 19 negates)</li>
					</list>
					<p>A staff of the magi gives the wielder spell resistance 23. If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff can also be used to absorb arcane spell energy directed at its wielder, as a rod of absorption does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough spell levels to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if a retributive strike had been performed (see below). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her, for the staff does not communicate this knowledge as a rod of absorption does. (Thus, absorbing spells can be risky.)</p>
					<h>Destruction</h>
					<p>A staff of the magi can be broken for a retributive strike. Such an act must be purposeful and declared by the wielder. All charges in the staff are released in a 30-foot spread. All within 10 feet of the broken staff take hit points of damage equal to 8 times the number of charges in the staff, those between 11 feet and 20 feet away take points equal to 6 times the number of charges, and those 21 feet to 30 feet distant take 4 times the number of charges. A DC 23 Reflex save reduces damage by half.</p>
					<p>The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance (01-50 on d%) of traveling to another plane of existence, but if she does not (51-100), the explosive release of spell energy destroys her (no saving throw).</p>

					<p>A <i>talisman of reluctant wishes</i> appears the same as a <i>stone of controlling earth elementals</i>, a rugged rock that seems to pulse with an inner power. Its powers are quite different, however, and are dependent on the Charisma of the holder. Any character touching a <i>talisman of reluctant wishes</i> must make a DC 15 Charisma check.</p>
					<p>If the check fails, the talisman acts as a <i>stone of weight</i>. Discarding it results in 5d6 points of damage to the character and the disappearance of the talisman.</p>
					<p>If the check succeeds, the talisman remains with the character for 5d6 hours, or until a <i>wish</i> is made with it, whichever comes first. It then disappears.</p>
					<p>If the check roll is a natural 20, the talisman remains for a number of months equal to the character's Charisma score, resisting any effort to get rid of it by reappearing in the character's possession, in a back pocket, at the bottom of his pack, or the like.</p>
					<p>The artifact grants one <i>wish</i> for every 6 points of the character's Charisma (round down). It grows warm and throbs whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical or magic trap. (If the talisman is not held, its warning heat and pulses are of no avail.)</p>
					<p>Regardless of which reaction results, a talisman of reluctant wishes disappears when its time expires, leaving behind a large diamond in its stead, valued at 1,000 gp per point of the character's Charisma.</p>
					<h>Destruction</h>
					<p>A talisman of reluctant wishes can be destroyed by wishing it so, using either one of the stone's wishes or a <i>wish</i> spell from another source. The stone then explodes, causing 5d6 points of damage to the holder.</p>

					<p>This small adamantine loop and handle is typically fitted with a fine adamantine chain so that it can be worn about as a necklace. A talisman of the sphere is worse than useless to those unable to cast arcane spells. Characters who cannot cast arcane spells take 5d6 points of damage merely from picking up and holding a talisman of this sort. However, when held by an arcane spellcaster who is concentrating on control of a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, a <i>talisman of the sphere</i> doubles the character's modifier on his control check (doubling both his Intelligence bonus and his character level for this purpose).</p>
					<p>If the wielder of a talisman establishes control, he need check for maintaining control only every other round thereafter. If control is not established, the sphere moves toward him. Note that while many spells and effects of cancellation have no effect upon a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, the talisman's power of control can be suppressed or canceled.</p>

					<p>A <i>necklace of strangulation</i> appears to be a wondrous piece of magical jewelry. When placed on the neck, the necklace immediately tightens, dealing 6 points of damage per round. It cannot be removed by any means short of a <i>limited wish</i>, <i>wish</i>, or <i>miracle</i> and remains clasped around the victim's throat even after his death. Only when he has decayed to a dry skeleton (after approximately 1 month) does the necklace loosen, ready for another victim.</p>

				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>This engraved gem appears to be of little value. If any character keeps the periapt in her possession for more than 24 hours, she contracts a terrible rotting affliction that permanently drains 1 point of Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma every week. The periapt (and the affliction) can be removed only by application of a <i>remove curse</i> spell followed by a cure disease and then a <i>heal</i>, <i>miracle</i>, <i>limited wish</i>, or <i>wish</i> spell. The rotting can also be countered by crushing a <i>periapt of health</i> and sprinkling its dust upon the afflicted character (a full-round action), whereupon the periapt of foul rotting likewise crumbles to dust.</p>

If the character is a spellcaster, the robe targets the character's primary spellcasting score, otherwise it targets Intelligence. The robe can be removed easily, but in order to restore mind and body, the character must receive a <i>remove curse</i> spell followed by <i>heal</i>.</p>

He must cease all other activities in order to scratch, shift the robe, and generally show signs of the extreme discomfort caused by the bites and movement of these pests.</p>
					<p>The wearer takes a -5 penalty on initiative checks and a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and skill checks. If he tries to cast a spell, he must make a concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose the spell.</p>

					<p>If this small scarab brooch is held for more than 1 round or carried in a living creature's possessions for 1 minute, it changes into a horrible burrowing beetle-like creature. The thing tears through any leather or cloth, burrows into flesh, and reaches the victim's heart in 1 round, causing death. A DC 25 Reflex save allows the wearer to tear the scarab away before it burrows out of sight, but he still takes 3d6 points of damage. The beetle then returns to its scarab form. Placing the scarab in a container of wood, ceramic, bone, ivory, or metal prevents it from coming to life and allows for long-term storage of the item.</p>

				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>All four kinds of elemental command rings are very powerful. Each appears to be nothing more than a lesser magic ring until fully activated (by meeting a special condition, such as single-handedly slaying an elemental of the appropriate type or exposure to a sacred material of the appropriate element), but each has certain other powers as well as the following common properties.</p>
					<p>Elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can't attack the wearer, or even approach within 5 feet of him. If the wearer desires, he may forego this protection and instead attempt to charm the elemental (as charm monster, Will DC 17 negates). If the charm attempt fails, however, absolute protection is lost and no further attempt at charming can be made.</p>
					<p>Creatures from the plane to which the ring is attuned who attack the wearer take a -1 penalty on their attack rolls. The ring wearer makes applicable saving throws against the extraplanar creature's attacks with a +2 resistance bonus. He gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack rolls against such creatures. Any weapon he uses bypasses the damage reduction of such creatures, regardless of any qualities the weapon may or may not have.</p>
					<p>The wearer of the ring is able to converse with creatures from the plane to which his ring is attuned. These creatures recognize that he wears the ring, and show a healthy respect for the wearer if alignments are similar. If alignments are opposed, creatures fear the wearer if he is strong. If he is weak, they hate and desire to slay him.</p>
					<p>The possessor of a ring of elemental command takes a saving throw penalty as follows:</p>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td><b>Element</b></td>
							<td><b>Saving Throw Penalty</b></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Water</td>
							<td>-2 against fire-based effects</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					<p>In addition to the powers described above, each specific ring gives its wearer the following abilities according to its kind.</p>
					<list>
						<li><i>Water walk</i> (unlimited use)</li>
						<li><i>Create water</i> (unlimited use)</li>
						<li><i>Water breathing</i> (unlimited use)</li>
						<li><i>Wall of ice</i> (once per day)</li>

			<ringram>
				<name type="string">Ring of the Ram</name>
				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>The <i>ring of the ram</i> is an ornate ring forged of hard metal, usually iron or an iron alloy. It has the head of a ram as its device.</p>
					<p>The wearer can command the ring to give forth a ram-like force, manifested by a vaguely discernible shape that resembles the head of a ram or a goat. This force strikes a single target, dealing 1d6 points of damage if 1 charge is expended, 2d6 points if 2 charges are used, or 3d6 points if 3 charges (the maximum) are used. Treat this as a ranged attack with a 50-foot maximum range and no penalties for distance.</p>
					<p>The force of the blow is considerable, and those struck by the ring are subject to a bull rush if within 30 feet of the ring-wearer. The ram is Large and uses the ring's caster level as its base attack bonus with a Strength of 25. This gives the ram a Combat Maneuver Bonus of +17. The ram gains a +1 bonus on the bull rush attempt if 2 charges are expended, or +2 if 3 charges are expended.</p>
					<p>In addition to its attack mode, the ring of the ram also has the power to open doors as if it were a character with Strength 25. This expends 1 charge. If 2 charges are expended, the effect is equivalent to a character with Strength 27. If 3 charges are expended, the effect is that of a character with Strength 29.</p>
					<p>A newly created ring has 50 charges. When all the charges are expended, the ring becomes a nonmagical item.</p>

				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>This ring has two modes of operation, one for being in shadowy darkness or outdoors at night and a second one when the wearer is underground or indoors at night.</p>
					<p>During the night, under the open sky or in areas of shadow or darkness, the ring of shooting stars can perform the following functions on command.</p>
					<list>
						<li><i>Dancing lights</i> (once per hour)</li>
						<li><i>Light</i> (twice per night)</li>
						<li>Ball lightning (special, once per night)</li>
						<li>Shooting stars (special, three per week)</li>
					</list>
					<p>The first special function, ball lightning, releases one to four balls of lightning (ring wearer's choice). These glowing globes resemble dancing lights, and the ring wearer controls them similarly (see the <i>dancing lights</i> spell description). The spheres have a 120-foot range and a duration of 4 rounds. They can be moved at 120 feet per round. Each sphere is about 3 feet in diameter, and any creature who comes within 5 feet of one causes its charge to dissipate, taking electricity damage in the process according to the number of balls created.</p>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td><b>Number of Balls</b></td>
							<td><b>Damage per Ball</b></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1 lightning ball</td>
							<td>4d6 points of electricity damage</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>2 lightning balls</td>
							<td>3d6 points of electricity damage each</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>3 lightning balls</td>
							<td>2d6 points of electricity damage each</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>4 lightning balls</td>
							<td>1d6 points of electricity damage each</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					<p>Once the ball lightning function is activated, the balls can be released at any time before the sun rises. Multiple balls can be released in the same round.</p>
					<p>The second special function produces three shooting stars that can be released from the ring each week, simultaneously or one at a time. They impact for 12 points of damage and spread (as a <i>fireball</i>) in a 5-foot-radius sphere for 24 points of fire damage.</p>
					<p>Any creature struck by a shooting star takes full damage from impact plus full fire damage from the spread unless it makes a DC 13 Reflex save. Creatures not struck but within the spread ignore the impact damage and take only half damage from the fire spread on a successful DC 13 Reflex save. Range is 70 feet, at the end of which the shooting star explodes unless it strikes a creature or object before that. A shooting star always follows a straight line, and any creature in its path must make a save or be hit by the projectile.</p>
					<p>Indoors at night, or underground, the ring of shooting stars has the following properties.</p>
					<list>
						<li><i>Faerie fire</i> (twice per day)</li>
						<li>Spark shower (special, once per day)</li>
					</list>
					<p>The spark shower is a flying cloud of sizzling purple sparks that fan out from the ring for a distance of 20 feet in an arc 10 feet wide. Creatures within this area take 2d8 points of damage each if not wearing metal armor or carrying a metal weapon. Those wearing metal armor and/or carrying a metal weapon take 4d8 points of damage.</p>

				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>On command, this ring gives its wearer the ability to see into and through solid matter. Vision range is 20 feet, with the viewer seeing as if he were looking at something in normal light even if there is no illumination. X-ray vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances or a thin sheet of lead blocks the vision.</p>
					<p>Using the ring is exhausting, causing the wearer 1 point of Constitution damage per minute after the first 10 minutes of use in a single day. The ring must be used in 1-minute increments.</p>

			<rodabsorption>
				<name type="string">Rod of Absorption</name>
				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>This rod absorbs spells or spell-like abilities into itself. The magic absorbed must be a single-target spell or a ray directed at either the character holding the rod or her gear. The rod then nullifies the spell's effect and stores its potential until the wielder releases this energy in the form of spells of her own. She can instantly detect a spell's level as the rod absorbs that spell's energy. Absorption requires no action on the part of the user if the rod is in hand at the time.</p>
					<p>A running total of absorbed (and used) spell levels should be kept. The wielder of the rod can use captured spell energy to cast any spell she has prepared, without expending the preparation itself. The only restrictions are that the levels of spell energy stored in the rod must be equal to or greater than the level of the spell the wielder wants to cast, that any material components required for the spell be present, and that the rod be in hand when casting. For casters such as bards or sorcerers who do not prepare spells, the rod's energy can be used to cast any spell of the appropriate level or levels that they know.</p>
					<p>A <i>rod of absorption</i> absorbs a maximum of 50 spell levels and can thereafter only discharge any remaining potential it might have. The rod cannot be recharged. The wielder knows the rod's remaining absorbing potential and current amount of stored energy.</p>
					<p>To determine the absorption potential remaining in a newly found rod, roll d% and divide the result by 2. Then roll d% again: on a result of 71-100, half the levels already absorbed by the rod are still stored within.</p>

				<name type="string">Rod of Alertness</name>
				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>This rod is indistinguishable from a <i>+1 light mace</i>. It has eight flanges on its macelike head. The rod bestows a +1 insight bonus on initiative checks. If grasped firmly, the rod enables the holder to use <i>detect evil</i>, <i>detect good</i>, <i>detect chaos</i>, <i>detect law</i>, <i>detect magic</i>, <i>discern lies</i>, <i>light</i>, or <i>see invisibility</i>. Each different use is a standard action.</p>
					<p>If the head of a <i>rod of alertness</i> is planted in the ground and the possessor wills it to alertness (a standard action), the rod senses any creatures within 120 feet who intend to harm the possessor. At the same time, the rod creates the effect of a <i>prayer</i> spell upon all creatures friendly to the possessor in a 20-foot radius. Immediately thereafter, the rod sends forth a mental alert to these friendly creatures, warning them of any unfriendly creatures within the 120-foot radius. These effects last for 10 minutes, and the rod can perform this function once per day. Last, the rod can be used to simulate the casting of an <i>animate objects</i> spell, utilizing any 11 (or fewer) Small objects located roughly around the perimeter of a 5-foot-radius circle centered on the rod when planted in the ground. Objects remain animated for 11 rounds. The rod can perform this function once per day.</p>

				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>This dreaded rod is a bane to magic items, for its touch drains an item of all magical properties. The item touched must make a DC 23 Will save to prevent the rod from draining it. If a creature is holding it at the time, then the item can use the holder's Will save bonus in place of its own if the holder's is better. In such cases, contact is made by making a melee touch attack roll. Upon draining an item, the rod itself becomes brittle and cannot be used again. Drained items are only restorable by <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i>. (If a <i>sphere of annihilation</i> and a <i>rod of cancellation</i> negate each other, nothing can restore either of them.)</p>

					<p>This device pulses in the wielder's hand and points in the direction of any creature or creatures hostile to the bearer of the device (nearest ones first). These creatures can be invisible, ethereal, hidden, disguised, or in plain sight. Detection range is 60 feet. If the bearer of the rod concentrates for a full round, the rod pinpoints the location of the nearest enemy and indicates how many enemies are within range. The rod can be used three times each day, each use lasting up to 10 minutes. Activating the rod is a standard action.</p>

					<p>Upon the command of its possessor, the rod activates, changing from a normal-seeming rod to a <i>+3/+3 dire flail</i>. The dire flail is a double weapon, which means that each of the weapon's heads can be used to attack. The wielder can gain an extra attack (with the second head) at the cost of making all attacks at a -2 penalty (as if she had the Two-Weapon Fighting feat).</p>
					<p>Once per day, the wielder can use a free action to cause the rod to grant her a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws for 10 minutes. The rod need not be in weapon form to grant this benefit.</p>
					<p>Transforming it into a weapon or back into a rod is a move action.</p>

				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>This rod can extinguish Medium or smaller nonmagical fires with simply a touch (a standard action). For the rod to be effective against other sorts of fires, the wielder must expend 1 or more of the rod's charges.</p>
					<p>Extinguishing a Large or larger nonmagical fire, or a magic fire of Medium or smaller (such as that of a <i>flaming</i> weapon or a <i>burning hands</i> spell), expends 1 charge. Continual magic flames, such as those of a weapon or a fire creature, are suppressed for 6 rounds and flare up again after that time. To extinguish an instantaneous fire spell, the rod must be within the area of the effect and the wielder must have used a ready action, effectively countering the entire spell.</p>
					<p>When applied to Large or larger magic fires, such as those caused by <i>fireball</i>, <i>flame strike</i>, or <i>wall of fire</i>, extinguishing the flames expends 2 charges from the rod.</p>
					<p>If a <i>rod of flame extinguishing</i> is touched to a creature with the fire subtype by making a successful melee touch attack, the rod deals 6d6 points of damage to the creature. This use requires 3 charges.</p>
					<p>A <i>rod of flame extinguishing</i> has 10 charges when found. Spent charges are renewed every day, so that a wielder can expend up to 10 charges in any 24-hour period.</p>

					<p>This rod looks like a flat iron bar with a small button on one end. When the button is pushed (a move action), the rod does not move from where it is, even if staying in place defies gravity. Thus, the owner can lift or place the rod wherever he wishes, push the button, and let go. Several <i>immovable rods</i> can even make a ladder when used together (although only two are needed). An <i>immovable rod</i> can support up to 8,000 pounds before falling to the ground. If a creature pushes against an <i>immovable rod</i>,  it must make a DC 30 Strength check to move the rod up to 10 feet in a single round.</p>

				<name type="string">Rod of Lordly Might</name>
				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>This rod has functions that are spell-like, and it can also be used as a magic weapon of various sorts. It also has several more mundane uses. The <i>rod of lordly might</i> is metal, thicker than other rods, with a flanged ball at one end and six studlike buttons along its length. Pushing any of the rod's buttons is equivalent to drawing a weapon, and the rod weighs 10 pounds.</p>
					<p>The following spell-like functions of the rod can each be used once per day.</p>
					<list>
						<li><i>Hold person</i> upon a touched creature, if the wielder so commands (Will DC 14 negates). The wielder must choose to use this power (a free action) and then succeed on a melee touch attack to activate the power. If the attack fails, the effect is lost.</li>
						<li><i>Fear</i> upon all enemies viewing it, if the wielder so desires (10-foot maximum range, Will DC 16 partial). Invoking this power is a standard action.</li>
						<li>Deal 2d4 hit points of damage to an opponent on a successful touch attack (Will DC 17 half ) and cure the wielder of the same amount of damage. The wielder must choose to use this power before attacking, as with <i>hold person</i>.</li>
					</list>
					<p>The following functions of the rod have no limit on the number of times they can be employed.</p>
					<list>
						<li>In its normal form, the rod can be used as a <i>+2 light mace</i>.</li>
						<li>When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a <i>+1 flaming longsword</i>. A blade springs from the ball, with the ball itself becoming the sword's hilt. The weapon stretches to an overall length of 4 feet.</li>
						<li>When button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a <i>+4 battleaxe</i>. A wide blade springs forth at the ball, and the whole lengthens to 4 feet.</li>
						<li>When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a <i>+3 shortspear</i> or <i>+3 longspear</i>. The spear blade springs forth, and the handle can be lengthened up to 12 feet (wielder's choice) for an overall length ranging from 6 feet to 15 feet. At its 15-foot length, the rod is suitable for use as a lance.</li>
					</list>
					<p>The following other functions of the rod also have no limit on the number of times they can be employed.</p>
					<list>
						<li>Climbing pole/ladder. When button 4 is pushed, a spike that can anchor in stone is extruded from the ball, while the other end sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 50 feet in a single round, stopping when button 4 is pushed again. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds. The wielder can retract the pole by pushing button 5.</li>
						<li>The ladder function can be used to force open doors. The wielder plants the rod's base 30 feet or less from the portal to be forced and in line with it, then pushes button 4. The force exerted has a Strength modifier of +12.</li>
						<li>When button 6 is pushed, the rod indicates magnetic north and gives the wielder knowledge of his approximate depth beneath the surface or height above it.</li>

					<p>This rod is valued by treasure hunters and miners alike, for it pulses and hums in the wielder's hand in the proximity of metal. As the wearer aims the rod, the pulsations grow more noticeable as it points to the largest mass of metal within 30 feet. However, the wielder can concentrate on a specific metal or mineral. If the specific mineral is within 30 feet, the rod points to any places it is located, and the rod wielder knows the approximate quantity as well. If more than one deposit of the specified metal or mineral is within range, the rod points to the largest cache first. Each operation requires a full-round action.</p>

					<p>This device negates the spell or spell-like function or functions of magic items. The wielder points the rod at the magic item, and a pale gray beam shoots forth to touch the target device, attacking as a ray (a ranged touch attack). The ray functions as a <i>greater dispel magic</i> spell, except it only affects magic items. To negate instantaneous effects from an item, the rod wielder needs to have used a ready action. The dispel check uses the rod's caster level (15th). The target item gets no saving throw, although the rod can't negate artifacts (even minor artifacts). The rod can function three times per day.</p>

					<p>Unlike most rods, one end of this rod curls and twists back on itself in a crook-the tip of this crook sometimes looks like the head of a snake. The rod itself is about 4 feet long and weighs 10 pounds. It strikes as a <i>+1/+1 quarterstaff</i>. If the user throws the rod to the ground (a standard action), it grows to become a constrictor snake by the end of the round. The python obeys all commands of the owner. (In animal form, it retains the +1 enhancement bonus on attacks and damage possessed by the rod form.) The serpent returns to rod form (a full-round action) whenever the wielder desires, or whenever it moves farther than 100 feet from the owner. If the snake form is slain, it returns to rod form and cannot be activated again for three days. A <i>rod of the python</i> only functions if the possessor is good.</p>

					<p>This rod looks like a royal scepter worth at least 5,000 gp in materials and workmanship alone. The wielder can command the obedience and fealty of creatures within 120 feet when she activates the device (a standard action). Creatures totaling 300 Hit Dice can be ruled, but creatures with Intelligence scores of 12 or higher are entitled to a DC 16 Will save to negate the effect. Ruled creatures obey the wielder as if she were their absolute sovereign. Still, if the wielder gives a command that is contrary to the nature of the creatures commanded, the magic is broken. The rod can be used for 500 total minutes before crumbling to dust. This duration need not be continuous.</p>

					<p>This item creates a nondimensional space, a pocket paradise. There the rod's possessor and as many as 199 other creatures can stay in complete safety for a period of time, up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures affected. All fractions are rounded down. In this pocket paradise, creatures don't age, and natural healing takes place at twice the normal rate. Fresh water and food (fruits and vegetables only) are in abundance. The climate is comfortable for all creatures involved.</p>
					<p>Activating the rod (a standard action) causes the wielder and all creatures touching the rod to be transported instantaneously to the paradise. Members of large groups can hold hands or otherwise maintain physical contact, allowing all connected creatures in a circle or a chain to be affected by the rod. Unwilling creatures get a DC 17 Will save to negate the effect. If such a creature succeeds on its save, other creatures beyond that point in a chain can still be affected by the rod.</p>
					<p>When the rod's effect expires, is dismissed, or is dispelled, all the affected creatures instantly reappear in the location they occupied when the rod was activated. If something else occupies the space that a traveler would be returning to, then his body is displaced a sufficient distance to provide the space required for reentry. The rod's possessor can dismiss the effect whenever he wishes before the maximum time period expires, but the rod can only be activated once per week.</p>

					<p>The possessor of this fantastically bejeweled rod gains a +4 enhancement bonus to her Charisma score for as long as she holds or carries the item. Once per day, the rod garbs her in magically created clothing of the finest fabrics, plus adornments of furs and jewels.</p>
					<p>Apparel created by the magic of the rod remains in existence for 12 hours. However, if the possessor attempts to sell or give away any part of it, use it for a spell component, or the like, all the apparel immediately disappears. The same applies if any of it is forcibly taken from her.</p>
					<p>The value of noble garb created by the rod ranges from 7,000 to 10,000 gp (1d4+6  1,000 gp)-1,000 gp for the fabric alone, 5,000 gp for the furs, and the rest for the jewel trim (maximum of twenty gems, maximum value 200 gp each).</p>
					<p>In addition, the rod has a second special power, usable once per week. Upon command, it creates a palatial tent - a huge pavilion of silk 60 feet across. Inside the tent are temporary furnishings and food suitable to the splendor of the pavilion and sufficient to entertain as many as 100 people. The tent and its trappings last for 1 day. At the end of that time, the tent and all objects associated with it (including any items that were taken out of the tent) disappear.</p>

					<p>Constructed of iron set with silver rivets, this rod has the properties of a <i>+2 light mace</i>. Its other magical powers are as follows.</p>
					<list>
						<li><b>Thunder:</b> Once per day, the rod can strike as a <i>+3 light mace</i>, and the opponent struck is stunned from the noise of the rod's impact (Fortitude DC 16 negates). Activating this sonic power counts as a free action, and it works if the wielder strikes an opponent within 1 round.</li>
						<li><b>Lightning:</b> Once per day, when the wielder desires, a short spark of electricity can leap forth when the rod strikes an opponent to deal the normal damage for a <i>+2 light mace</i> (1d6+2) and an extra 2d6 points of electricity damage. Even when the rod might not score a normal hit in combat, if the roll was good enough to count as a successful melee touch attack, then the 2d6 points of electricity damage still apply. The wielder activates this power as a free action, and it works if he strikes an opponent within 1 round.</li>
						<li><b>Thunderclap:</b> Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to give out a deafening noise, just as a shout spell (Fortitude DC 16 partial, 2d6 points of sonic damage, target deafened for 2d6 rounds).</li>
						<li><b>Lightning Stroke:</b> Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to shoot out a 5-foot-wide <i>lightning bolt</i> (9d6 points of electricity damage, Reflex DC 16 half ) to a range of 200 feet.</li>
						<li><b>Thunder and Lightning:</b> Once per week as a standard action, the wielder of the rod can combine the thunderclap described above with a <i>lightning bolt</i>, as in the lightning stroke. The thunderclap affects all within 10 feet of the bolt. The lightning stroke deals 9d6 points of electricity damage (count rolls of 1 or 2 as rolls of 3, for a range of 27 to 54 points), and the thunderclap deals 2d6 points of sonic damage. A single DC 16 Reflex save applies for both effects.</li>

					<p>This rod strikes as a <i>+2 heavy mace</i>. Once per day, upon command, the head of the rod becomes that of an actual serpent for 10 minutes. During this period, any successful strike with the rod deals its usual damage and also poisons the creature hit. The poison deals 1d3 points of Constitution damage per round for 6 rounds. Poisoned creatures can make a DC 16 Fortitude save each round to negate the damage and end the affliction. Multiple hits extend the duration by 3 rounds and increase the DC by +2 for each hit.

					<p>As a move action, an animated shield can be loosed to defend its wielder on its own. For the following 4 rounds, the shield grants its bonus to the one who loosed it and then drops. While animated, the shield provides its shield bonus and the bonuses from all of the other shield special abilities it possesses, but it cannot take actions on its own, such as those provided by the bashing and blinding abilities. It can, however, use special abilities that do not require an action to function, such as arrow deflection and reflecting. While animated, a shield shares the same space as the activating character and accompanies the character who activated it, even if the character moves by magical means. A character with an animated shield still takes any penalties associated with shield use, such as armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, and nonproficiency. If the wielder who loosed it has an unoccupied hand, she can grasp it to end its animation as a free action. Once a shield has been retrieved, it cannot be animated again for at least 4 rounds.</p>

					<p>A shield with this ability attracts ranged weapons to it. It has a deflection bonus of +1 against ranged weapons because projectiles and thrown weapons veer toward it. Additionally, any projectile or thrown weapon aimed at a target within 5 feet of the shield's wearer diverts from its original target and targets the shield's bearer instead. If the wielder has total cover relative to the attacker, the projectile or thrown weapon is not diverted. Additionally, those attacking the wearer with ranged weapons ignore any miss chances that would normally apply. Projectiles and thrown weapons that have an enhancement bonus higher than the shield's base AC bonus are not diverted to the wearer (but the shield's deflection bonus still applies against these weapons). The wielder can activate or deactivate this ability with a command word.</p>

He must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon doesn't count as an action. Exceptional ranged weapons, such as boulders hurled by giants or acid arrows, can't be deflected.</p>

					<p>The <i>staff of power</i> is a very potent magic item with offensive and defensive abilities. It is usually topped with a glistening gem that often burns from within with a flickering red light. The staff allows the use of the following spells:</p>
					<list>
						<li><i>Continual flame</i> (1 charge)</li>
						<li><i>Fireball</i> (heightened to 5th level) (1 charge)</li>
						<li><i>Levitate</i> (1 charge)</li>
						<li><i>Lightning bolt</i> (heightened to 5th level) (1 charge)</li>
						<li><i>Magic missile</i> (1 charge)</li>
						<li><i>Ray of Enfeeblement</i> (heightened to 5th level) (1 charge)</li>
						<li><i>Cone of cold</i> (2 charges)</li>
						<li><i>Globe of invulnerability</i> (2 charges)</li>
						<li><i>Hold monster</i> (2 charges)</li>
						<li><i>Wall of force</i> (in a 10-ft.-diameter hemisphere around the caster only) (2 charges)</li>
					</list>
					<p>The wielder of a <i>staff of power</i> gains a +2 luck bonus to AC and on saving throws. The staff is also a <i>+2 quarterstaff</i>, and its wielder may use it to smite opponents. If 1 charge is expended (as a free action), the staff causes double damage (3 on a critical hit) for 1 round.</p>
					<p>A <i>staff of power</i> can be used for a retributive strike, requiring it to be broken by its wielder. (If this breaking of the staff is purposeful and declared by the wielder, it can be performed as a standard action that does not require the wielder to make a Strength check.) All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30- foot spread. All within 2 squares of the broken staff take points of damage equal to 20  the number of charges in the staff, those 3 or 4 squares away take 15 the number of charges in damage, and those 5 or 6 squares distant take 10  the number of charges in damage. All those affected can make DC 17 Reflex saves to reduce the damage by half.</p>
					<p>The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane of existence, but if he does not, the explosive release of spell energy destroys him. Only certain items, including the staff of the magi and the staff of power, are capable of being used for a retributive strike.</p>

If the save is successful, the sword's death-dealing ability does not function, no use of the ability is expended, and normal critical damage is determined. This sword is evil, and any good character attempting to wield it gains two negative levels.

					<p>This sword is the size of a bastard sword. However, a sun blade is wielded as if it were a short sword with respect to weight and ease of use. In other words, the weapon appears to all viewers to be a bastard sword, and deals bastard sword damage, but the wielder feels and reacts as if the weapon were a short sword. Any individual able to use either a bastard sword or a short sword with proficiency is proficient in the use of a sun blade. Likewise, Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization in short sword and bastard sword apply equally, but the benefits of those feats do not stack.</p>
					<p>In normal combat, the glowing golden blade of the weapon is equal to a <i>+2 bastard sword</i>. Against evil creatures, its enhancement bonus is +4. Against Negative Energy Plane creatures or undead creatures, the sword deals double damage (and 3 on a critical hit instead of the usual 2).</p>
					<p>The blade also has a special sunlight power. Once per day, the wielder can swing the blade vigorously above his head while speaking a command word. The sun blade then sheds a bright yellow radiance that acts like bright light and affects creatures susceptible to light as if it were natural sunlight. The radiance begins shining in a 10-foot radius around the sword wielder and extends outward at 5 feet per round for 10 rounds thereafter, to create a globe of light with a 60-foot radius.

					<p>If a bag of holding is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag immediately ruptures and is ruined, and all contents are lost forever. If a bag of holding is turned inside out, all of its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a bag of holding is a move action, unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action. Magic items placed inside the bag do not offer any benefit to the character carrying the bag.</p>
					<p>If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the space: bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: the hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the portable hole and bag of holding in the process.</p>

				<name type="string">Bead of Force</name>
				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>This small black sphere appears to be a lusterless pearl. A bead of force can be thrown up to 60 feet with no range penalties. Upon sharp impact, the bead explodes, sending forth a burst that deals 5d6 points of force damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius.</p>
					<p>Once thrown, a bead of force functions like a <i>resilient sphere</i> spell (Reflex DC 16 negates) with a radius of 10 feet and a duration of 10 minutes. A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the latter is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from a rod of cancellation, a rod of negation, <i>disintegrate</i>, or a targeted <i>dispel magic</i> spell. These effects destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally. The subject may struggle, but the globe cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within. The explosion completely consumes the bead, making this a one-use item.</p>

Yet when the proper command word is given, the box unfolds itself rapidly in the space of a single round to form a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet in depth. A second command word causes it to unfold even further into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The folding boat cannot unfold if there isn't enough open space for it to occupy once unfolded. Any objects formerly stored in the box now rest inside the boat or ship.</p>
					<p>In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. In its larger form, the boat has a deck, single rowing seats, five sets of oars, a rudder, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The boat can hold 4 people comfortably, while the ship carries 15 with ease.</p>
					<p>A third word of command causes the boat or ship to fold itself into a box once again, but only when it is unoccupied.</p>

				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>A <i>chime of opening</i> is a hollow mithral tube about 1 foot long. When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on. A <i>chime of opening</i> also automatically dispels a <i>hold portal</i> spell or even an <i>arcane lock</i> cast by a wizard of lower than 15th level.</p>
					<p>The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck and a clear tone rings forth. The wielder can make a caster level check against the lock or binding, using the chime's caster level of 11th. The DC of this check is equal to the Disable Device DC to open the lock or binding. Each sounding only opens one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and <i>arcane locked</i>, it takes four successful uses of a chime of opening to get it open. A silence spell negates the power of the device. A brandnew chime can be used a total of 10 times before it cracks and becomes useless.</p>

At all times it obeys the desires of the character who drew the card. When the illusion is dispelled, the card becomes blank and cannot be used again. If the card is picked up, the illusion is automatically and instantly dispelled. The cards in a deck and the illusions they bring forth are summarized on the following table. (Use one of the first two columns to simulate the contents of a full deck using either ordinary playing cards or tarot cards.)</p>
					<p>A randomly generated deck is usually complete (11-100 on d%), but may be discovered (01-10) with 1d20 of its cards missing. If cards are missing, reduce the price by a corresponding amount.</p>

					<p>If the dust is employed against an outsider with the elemental and water subtypes, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save or be destroyed. The dust deals 5d6 points of damage to the creature even if its saving throw succeeds.</p>

					<p>A handful of dust sprinkled along a trail causes evidence of the passage of as many as a dozen men and horses to be obliterated for 250 feet back into the distance. The results of the dust are instantaneous, and no magical aura lingers afterward from this use of the dust.

The second slightly longer compartment holds up to 18 objects of the same general size and shape as a javelin. The third and longest portion of the case contains as many as 6 objects of the same general size and shape as a bow (spears, staffs, or the like). Once the owner has filled it, the quiver can quickly produce any item she wishes that is within the quiver, as if from a regular quiver or scabbard.

There is a 10% chance (01-10 on d%) that the efreeti is insane and attacks immediately upon being released. There is also a 10% chance (91-100) that the efreeti of the bottle grants three wishes. In either case, afterward the efreeti disappears forever, and the bottle becomes nonmagical. The other 80% of the time (11-90), the inhabitant of the bottle loyally serves the character for up to 10 minutes per day (or until the efreeti's death), doing as she commands. Roll each day the bottle is opened for that day's effect.</p>

					<p>Ivory Goats: These figurines come in threes. Each goat of this trio looks slightly different from the others, and each has a different function:</p>
					<list>
						<li>The Goat of Traveling: This statuette provides a speedy and enduring mount equal to that of a heavy horse in every way except appearance. The goat can travel for a maximum of 1 day each week - continuously or in any combination of periods totaling 24 hours. At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it returns to its statuette form for no less than 1 day before it can again be used.</li>
						<li>The Goat of Travail: This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics of a nightmare except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each horn). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns (but add 6 points of damage to each successful attack in that round). It can be called to life just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time.</li>
						<li>The Goat of Terror: When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount with the statistics of a light horse. However, its rider can employ the goat's horns as weapons (one horn as a <i>+3 heavy lance</i>, the other as a <i>+5 longsword</i>). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the goat of terror radiates <i>fear</i> as the spell in a 30-foot radius (Will DC 16 partial). It can be used once every 2 weeks for up to 3 hours per use.</li>

					<p>Obsidian Steed: This figurine appears to be a small, shapeless lump of black stone. Only careful inspection reveals that it vaguely resembles some form of quadruped. On command, the nearformless piece of obsidian becomes a fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy horse with the following additional powers usable once per round at will: <i>overland flight</i>, <i>plane shift</i>, and <i>ethereal jaunt</i>. The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10% likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when an obsidian steed becomes ethereal or plane shifts, its rider and his gear follow suit. Thus, the user can travel to other planes via this means.</p>

Another command sends it off into the air, bearing a message just like a creature affected by an animal messenger spell. If not commanded to carry a message, the raven obeys the commands of its owner, although it has no special powers or telepathic abilities.

					<p>A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It is constructed of finely tanned leather, and the straps have brass hardware and buckles. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a bag of holding and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.</p>
					<p>While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does.</p>

				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>This normal-looking helm takes its true form and manifests its powers when the user dons it and speaks the command word. Made of brilliant silver and polished steel, a newly created helm is set with large magic gems: 10 diamonds, 20 rubies, 30 fire opals, and 40 opals. When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and sends forth reflective rays in all directions from its crown-like, gem-tipped spikes. The jewels' functions are as follows:</p>
					<list>
						<li>Diamond: <i>Prismatic spray</i> (save DC 20)</li>
						<li>Ruby: <i>Wall of fire</i></li>
						<li>Fire opal: <i>Fireball</i> (10d6, Reflex DC 20 half )</li>
						<li>Opal: <i>Daylight</i></li>
					</list>
					<p>The helm may be used once per round, but each gem can perform its spell-like power just once. Until all its jewels are depleted, a helm of brilliance also has the following magical properties when activated.</p>
					<list>
						<li>It emanates a bluish light when undead are within 30 feet. This light causes 1d6 points of damage per round to all such creatures within that range.</li>
						<li>The wearer may command any weapon he wields to become a <i>flaming weapon</i>. This is in addition to whatever abilities the weapon may already have (unless the weapon already is a <i>flaming weapon</i>). The command takes 1 round to take effect.</li>
						<li>The helm provides fire resistance 30. This protection does not stack with similar protection from other sources.</li>
					</list>
					<p>Once all its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses its powers and the gems turn to worthless powder. Removing a jewel destroys it.</p>
					<p>If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical fire (after the fire protection is taken into account) and fails an additional DC 15 Will save, the remaining gems on the helm overload and detonate. Remaining diamonds become <i>prismatic sprays</i> that each randomly target a creature within range (possibly the wearer), rubies become straight-line <i>walls of fire</i> extending outward in a random direction from the helm wearer, and fire opals become <i>fireballs</i> centered on the helm wearer. The opals and the helm itself are destroyed.</p>

(Weeds, obstructions, and the like block vision in the usual manner.) If the command word is spoken, the helm of underwater action gives the wearer a 30-foot swim speed and creates a globe of air around the wearer's head and maintains it until the command word is spoken again, enabling her to breathe freely.</p>

					<p>This small bugle allows its possessor to blow forth a thick cloud of heavy fog similar to that of an <i>obscuring mist</i> spell. The fog covers a 10-foot square next to the horn blower each round that the user continues to blow the horn; a fog cloud travels 10 feet each round in a straight line from the emanation point unless blocked by something substantial such as a wall. The device makes a deep, foghorn-like noise, with the note dropping abruptly to a lower register at the end of each blast. The fog dissipates after 3 minutes. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.</p>

					<p>This magic instrument comes in four varieties. Each appears to be normal until someone speaks its command word and blows the horn. Then the horn summons a number of human barbarians to fight for the character who summoned them. Each horn can be blown just once every 7 days. Roll d% and refer to the table above to see what type of horn is found. The horn's type determines what barbarians are summoned and what prerequisite is needed to use the horn. Any character who uses a horn of Valhalla but doesn't have the prerequisite is attacked by the barbarians she herself summoned.</p>
					<p>Summoned barbarians are constructs, not actual people (though they seem to be); they arrive with the starting equipment for barbarians. They attack anyone the possessor of the horn commands them to fight until they or their opponents are slain or until 1 hour has elapsed, whichever comes first.</p>

					<p>These four iron shoes are affixed like normal horseshoes. They allow a horse to travel without actually touching the ground. The horse must still run above (always around 4 inches above) a roughly horizontal surface. This means that non-solid or unstable surfaces can be crossed, and that movement is possible without leaving tracks on any sort of ground. The horse moves at its normal base land speed.

The fortress has a small door that opens only at the command of the owner of the fortress - even <i>knock</i> spells can't open the door.</p>

					<p>The fortress springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing the device's owner. The door opens and closes instantly at his command. People and creatures nearby (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the fortress's sudden growth. Anyone so caught takes 10d10 points of damage (Reflex DC 19 half ).</p>
					<p>The fortress is deactivated by speaking a command word (different from the one used to activate it). It cannot be deactivated unless it is empty.</p>

					<p>This potent item appears to be a 3-inch-diameter rusty iron sphere with bandings on the globe.</p>
					<p>When the proper command word is spoken and the spherical iron device is hurled at an opponent, the bands expand and then contract to bind the target creature on a successful ranged touch attack. A single Large or smaller creature can be captured thus and held immobile (as if pinned) until the command word is spoken to bring the bands into spherical form again. The creature can break (and destroy) the bands with a DC 30 Strength check or escape them with a DC 30 combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check. Iron bands of binding are usable once per day.</p>

				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>These special containers are typically inlaid with runes of silver and stoppered by a brass plug bearing a seal engraved with sigils, glyphs, and special symbols. When the user speaks the command word, he can force any creature from another plane into the container, provided that creature fails a DC 19 Will save. The range of this effect is 60 feet. Only one creature at a time can be so contained. Loosing the stopper frees the captured creature.</p>
					<p>The command word can be used only once per day.</p>
					<p>If the individual freeing the captured creature speaks the command word, the creature can be forced to serve for 1 hour. If freed without the command word, the creature acts according to its natural inclinations. (It usually attacks the user, unless it perceives a good reason not to.) Any attempt to force the same creature into the flask a second time provides it a +2 bonus on its saving throw and makes it hostile. A newly discovered bottle might contain any of the following:</p>

				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>This magical instrument is usually made of gold and inlaid with numerous gems. If the proper chords are struck, a single use of this lyre negates any attacks made against inanimate construction (walls, roof, floor, and so on) within 300 feet. This includes the effects of a horn of blasting, a <i>disintegrate</i> spell, or an attack from a ram or similar siege weapon. The lyre can be used in this way once per day, with the protection lasting for 30 minutes.</p>
					<p>The lyre is also useful with respect to building. Once a week, its strings can be strummed so as to produce chords that magically construct buildings, mines, tunnels, ditches, etc. The effect produced in 30 minutes of playing is equal to the work of 100 humans laboring for 3 days. Each hour after the first, a character playing the lyre must make a DC 18 Perform (string instruments) check. If it fails, she must stop and cannot play the lyre again for this purpose until a week has passed.</p>

				<name type="string">Marvelous Pigments</name>
				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>These pigments enable their possessor to create actual, permanent objects simply by depicting their form in two dimensions. The pigments are applied by a stick tipped with bristles, hair, or fur. The emulsion flows from the application to form the desired object as the artist concentrates on the image. One pot of marvelous pigments is sufficient to create a 1,000-cubic-foot object by depicting it two-dimensionally over a 100-square-foot surface.</p>
					<p>Only normal, inanimate objects can be created. Creatures can't be created. The pigments must be applied to a surface. It takes 10 minutes and a DC 15 Craft (painting) check to depict an object with the pigments. Marvelous pigments cannot create magic items. Objects of value depicted by the pigments-precious metals, gems, jewelry, ivory, and so on-appear to be valuable but are really made of tin, lead, glass, brass, bone, and other such inexpensive materials. The user can create normal weapons, armor, and any other mundane item (including foodstuffs) whose value does not exceed 2,000 gp. The effect is instantaneous.</p>

					<p>This fearsome-looking mask of ivory, beaten copper, or pale wood is typically fashioned into the likeness of a human skull with a missing lower jaw, allowing the bottom half of the wearer's face to remain visible when the mask is worn.</p>
					<p>Once per day, after it has been worn for at least 1 hour, the mask can be loosed to fly from the wearer's face. It travels up to 50 feet away from the wearer and attacks a target assigned to it. The grinning skull mask makes a touch attack against the target based on the wearer's base attack bonus. If the attack succeeds, the target must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or take 130 points of damage, as if affected by a <i>finger of death</i> spell. If the target succeeds on his saving throw, he nevertheless takes 3d6+13 points of damage. After attacking (whether successful or not), the mask flies back to its user. The mask has AC 16, 10 hit points, and hardness 6.</p>

				<name type="string">Mirror of Life Trapping</name>
				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>This crystal device is usually about 4 feet square and framed in metal or wood. The frame typically depicts dragons, demons, devils, genies, coiling nagas, or other powerful creatures that are well known for their magical powers. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by giving a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. A mirror of life trapping has 15 extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must make a DC 23 Will save or be trapped within the mirror in one of the cells. A creature not aware of the nature of the device always sees its own reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection, and thus needing to make the saving throw, drops to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror traps life and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack).</p>
					<p>When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is not a factor, but constructs and undead are not trapped, nor are inanimate objects and other nonliving matter. A victim's equipment (including clothing and anything being carried) remains behind. If the mirror's owner knows the right command word, he can call the reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage his powerless prisoner in conversation. Another command word frees the trapped creature. Each pair of command words is specific to each prisoner.</p>
					<p>If the mirror's capacity is exceeded, one victim (determined randomly) is set free in order to accommodate the latest one. If the mirror is destroyed (Hardness 1, 5 hit points), all victims currently trapped in it are freed.</p>

					<p>This item resembles a normal mirror about 4 feet long and 3 feet wide. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by speaking a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. If a creature sees its reflection in the mirror's surface, an exact duplicate of that creature comes into being. This opposite immediately attacks the original. The duplicate has all the possessions and powers of its original (including magic). Upon the defeat or destruction of either the duplicate or the original, the duplicate and its items disappear completely. The mirror functions up to four times per day. Destroying the mirror (Hardness 1, 5 hit points) causes all of the duplicates to immediately vanish.</p>

				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>This device appears to be nothing but beads on a string, sometimes with the ends tied together to form a necklace. (It does not count as an item worn around the neck for the purpose of determining which of a character's worn magic items is effective.) If a character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really is - a golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a <i>fireball</i> spell (Reflex DC 14 half ).</p>
					<p>Spheres come in different strengths, ranging from those that deal 2d6 points of fire damage to those that deal 10d6. The market price of a sphere is 150 gp for each die of damage it deals.</p>
					<p>Each necklace of fireballs contains a combination of spheres of various strengths. Some traditional combinations, designated types I through VII, are detailed below.</p>
					<p>If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her saving throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make a saving throw as well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace fails to save, all its remaining spheres detonate simultaneously, often with regrettable consequences for the wearer.</p>

					<p>A portable hole is a circle of cloth spun from the webs of a phase spider interwoven with strands of ether and beams of starlight, resulting in a portable extradimensional space. When opened fully, a portable hole is 6 feet in diameter, but it can be folded up to be as small as a pocket handkerchief. When spread upon any surface, it causes an extradimensional space 10 feet deep to come into being. This hole can be picked up from inside or out by simply taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Either way, the entrance disappears, but anything inside the hole remains, traveling with the item.</p>
					<p>The only air in the hole is that which enters when the hole is opened. It contains enough air to supply one Medium creature or two Small creatures for 10 minutes. The cloth does not accumulate weight even if its hole is filled. Each portable hole opens on its own particular nondimensional space. If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in that place. Both the bag and the cloth are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, the portable hole and bag of holding being destroyed in the process.</p>

The same is true with respect to a black robe donned by a good character. An evil or good character who puts on a gray robe, or a neutral character who dons either a white or black robe, gains two permanent negative levels.

					<p>A rope of entanglement looks just like any other hempen rope about 30 feet long. Upon command, the rope lashes forward 20 feet or upward 10 feet to entangle a victim. An entangled creature can break free with a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape Artist check.</p>
					<p>A rope of entanglement has AC 22, 12 hit points, hardness 10, and damage reduction 5/slashing. The rope repairs damage to itself at a rate of 1 point per 5 minutes, but if a rope of entanglement is severed (all 12 hit points lost to damage), it is destroyed.</p>

				<description type="formattedtext">
					<p>This pale amber substance is thick and viscous. Because of its particular powers, it can be contained only in a flask whose inside has been coated with 1 ounce of salve of slipperiness, and each time any of the bonding agent is poured from the flask, a new application of the salve of slipperiness must be put in the flask within 1 round to prevent the remaining glue from adhering to the side of the container. A flask of sovereign glue, when found, holds anywhere from 1 to 7 ounces of the stuff (1d8-1, minimum 1), with the other ounce of the flask's capacity taken up by the salve of slipperiness. One ounce of this adhesive covers 1 square foot of surface, bonding virtually any two substances together in a permanent union. The glue takes 1 round to set. If the objects are pulled apart (a move action) before that time has elapsed, that application of the glue loses its stickiness and is worthless. If the glue is allowed to set, then attempting to separate the two bonded objects has no effect, except when universal solvent is applied to the bond. Sovereign glue is dissolved by universal solvent.</p>

			<name type="string">Armor</name>
			<description type="formattedtext">
				<p>In general, magic armor protects the wearer to a greater extent than non-magical armor. Magic armor bonuses are enhancement bonuses, never rise above +5, and stack with regular armor bonuses (and with shield and magic shield enhancement bonuses). All magic armor is also masterwork armor, reducing armor check penalties by 1.</p>
				<p>In addition to an enhancement bonus, armor may have special abilities. Special abilities usually count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of an item, but do not improve AC. A suit of armor cannot have an effective bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents, including those from character abilities and spells) higher than +10. A suit of armor with a special ability must also have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.</p>
				<p>A suit of armor or a shield may be made of an unusual material. Roll d% (percent dice) to determine if it is special or standard material: A roll of 01-95 indicates that the item is made of standard materials, a roll of 96-100 indicates that it is made of a special material.</p>
				<p>Armor is always created so that if the type of armor comes with a pair of boots, a helm, or a set of gauntlets, these pieces can be switched for other magic boots, helms, or gauntlets.</p>
				<p><b>Caster Level for Armor and Shields:</b> The caster level of a magic shield or magic armor with a special ability is given in the item Description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.</p>
				<p><b>Shields:</b> The caster level of a magic shield or magic armor with a special ability is given in the item Description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.</p>
				<p>A shield could be built that also acted as a magic weapon, but the cost of the enhancement bonus on attack rolls would need to be added into the cost of the shield and its enhancement bonus to AC.</p>
				<p>As with armor, special abilities built into the shield add to the market value in the form of additions to the bonus of the shield, although they do not improve AC. A shield cannot have an effective bonus (enhancement plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A shield with a special ability must also have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.</p>
				<p><b>Activation:</b> Usually a character benefits from magic armor and shields in exactly the way a character benefits from nonmagical armor and shields: by wearing them. If armor or a shield has a special ability that the user needs to activate, then the user usually needs to utter the command word (a standard action).</p>
				<p><b>Armor for Unusual Creatures:</b> The cost of armor for non-humanoid creatures, as well as for creatures who are neither Small nor Medium, varies (see Equipment). The cost of the masterwork quality and any magical enhancement remains the same.</p>
				<p>Most magic armor and shields only have enhancement bonuses. Such items can also have one or more of the special abilities detailed below:</p>

			<description type="formattedtext">
				<p>There exist throughout the world items that were never meant for the hands of mortals, powers that by all rights should solely be the province of divine beings and the elemental forces of creation. Yet occasionally, whether by accident, calamity, or strange fate, shards of such impossible might do fall into the hands of mortals. These motes of the unfathomable are called artifacts, and where they pass, lands shudder, nations rise, and legends are born.</p>
				<p>Rather than merely another form of magical equipment, artifacts are the sorts of legendary relics that might become the focus of whole campaigns-sparking quests to recover them, fights against their wielders, missions to destroy them, and more.</p>
				<p>Unlike normal magic items, artifacts are not easily destroyed (and are impossible for PCs to create). Instead of construction information, each artifact includes one possible means by which it might be destroyed.</p>
				<p>Artifacts should never be purchased or found as part of a random treasure hoard. When placing an artifact in your game, be sure to consider its impact, but also keep in mind that artifacts are fickle objects, and if they become too much of a nuisance, they can easily become lost once more.</p>
				<p>Minor artifacts are not necessarily unique items. Even so, they are magic items that no longer can be created, at least by common mortal means.</p>
				<p>Major artifacts are unique itemsonly one of each such item exists. These are the most potent of magic items, capable of altering the balance of a campaign. Unlike all other magic items, major artifacts are not easily destroyed. Each should have only a single, specific means of destruction.</p>

			<name type="string">Cursed items</name>
			<description type="formattedtext">
				<p>Cursed items are any magic items with some sort of potentially negative impact on the user. Occasionally they mix bad with good, forcing characters to make difficult choices. Cursed items are almost never made intentionally. Instead they are the result of rushed work, inexperienced crafters, or a lack of proper components. While many of these items still have functions, they either do not work as intended or come with serious drawbacks. When a magic item creation skill check fails by 5 or more, roll on Table: Common Item Curses to determine the type of curse possessed by the item.</p>
				<p><b>Identifying Cursed Items:</b> Cursed items are identified like any other magic item with one exception: unless the check made to identify the item exceeds the DC by 10 or more, the curse is not detected. If the check is not made by 10 or more, but still succeeds, all that is revealed is the magic item's original intent. If the item is known to be cursed, the nature of the curse can be determined using the standard DC to identify the item.</p>
				<p><b>Removing Cursed Items:</b> While some cursed items can be simply discarded, others force a compulsion upon the user to keep the item, no matter the costs. Others reappear even if discarded or are impossible to throw away. These items can only be discarded after the character or item is targeted by a remove curse or similar magic. The DC of the caster level check to undo the curse is equal to 10 + the item's caster level. If the spell is successful, the item can be discarded on the following round, but the curse reasserts itself if the item is used again.</p>

			<description type="formattedtext">
				<p>A potion is a magic liquid that produces its effect when imbibed. Potions vary incredibly in appearance. Magic oils are similar to potions, except that oils are applied externally rather than imbibed. A potion or oil can be used only once. It can duplicate the effect of a spell of up to 3rd level that has a casting time of less than 1 minute and targets one or more creatures or objects.</p>
				<p>Potions are like spells cast upon the imbiber. The character taking the potion doesn't get to make any decisions about the effect-the caster who brewed the potion has already done so. The drinker of a potion is both the effective target and the caster of the effect (though the potion indicates the caster level, the drinker still controls the effect).</p>
				<p>The person applying an oil is the effective caster, but the object is the target.</p>
				<p><b>Physical Description:</b> A typical potion or oil consists of 1 ounce of liquid held in a ceramic or glass vial fitted with a tight stopper. The stoppered container is usually no more than 1 inch wide and 2 inches high. The vial has Armor Class 13, 1 hit point, hardness 1, and a break DC of 12.</p>
				<p><b>Identifying Potions:</b> In addition to the standard methods of identification, PCs can sample from each container they find to attempt to determine the nature of the liquid inside with a Perception check. The DC of this check is equal to 15 + the spell level of the potion (although this DC might be higher for rare or unusual potions).</p>
				<p><b>Activation:</b>  Drinking a potion or applying an oil requires no special skill. The user merely removes the stopper and swallows the potion or smears on the oil. The following rules govern potion and oil use.</p>
				<p>Drinking a potion or using an oil is a standard action. The potion or oil takes effect immediately. Using a potion or oil provokes attacks of opportunity. An enemy may direct an attack of opportunity against the potion or oil container rather than against the character. A successful attack of this sort can destroy the container, preventing the character from drinking the potion or applying the oil.</p>
				<p>A creature must be able to swallow a potion or smear on an oil. Because of this, incorporeal creatures cannot use potions or oils. Any corporeal creature can imbibe a potion or use an oil.</p>
				<p>A character can carefully administer a potion to an unconscious creature as a full-round action, trickling the liquid down the creature's throat. Likewise, it takes a full-round action to apply an oil to an unconscious creature.</p>

			<name type="string">Rings</name>
			<description type="formattedtext">
				<p>Rings bestow magical powers upon their wearers. Only a rare few have charges-most magic rings are permanent and potent magic items. Anyone can use a ring.</p>
				<p>A character can only effectively wear two magic rings. A third magic ring doesn't work if the wearer is already wearing two magic rings.</p>
				<p><b>Physical Description:</b> Rings have no appreciable weight. Although exceptions exist that are crafted from glass or bone, the vast majority of rings are forged from metal-usually precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum. A ring has AC 13, 2 hit points, hardness 10, and a break DC of 25.</p>
				<p><b>Activation:</b> A ring's ability is usually activated by a spoken command word (a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity) or its effects work continually. Some rings have unusual activations, as mentioned in the ring's specific description.</p>
				<p><b>Special Qualities:</b> Roll d%. A result of 01 indicates the ring is intelligent, 02-31 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32-100 indicates no special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes. Rings with charges can never be intelligent.</p>

			<description type="formattedtext">
				<p>Rods are scepter-like devices that have unique magical powers and usually do not have charges. Anyone can use a rod.</p>
				<p><b>Physical Description:</b> Rods weigh approximately 5 pounds. They range from 2 feet to 3 feet long and are usually made of iron or some other metal. (Many, as noted in their descriptions, can function as light maces or clubs because of their hardy construction.) These sturdy items have AC 9, 10 hit points, hardness 10, and a break DC of 27.</p>
				<p><b>Activation:</b> Details relating to rod use vary from item to item. Unless noted otherwise, you must be holding a rod to use its abilities . See the individual descriptions for specifics.</p>
				<p><b>Special Qualities:</b> Roll d%. A 01 result indicates the rod is intelligent, 02-31 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32-100 indicates no special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes. Rods with charges can never be intelligent.</p>

		<scroll>
			<name type="string">Scrolls</name>
			<description type="formattedtext">
				<p>A scroll is a spell (or collection of spells) that has been stored in written form. A spell on a scroll can be used only once. The writing vanishes from the scroll when the spell is activated. Using a scroll is basically like casting a spell.</p>
				<p><b>Physical Description:</b> A scroll is a heavy sheet of fine vellum or high-quality paper. An area about 8-1/2 inches wide and 11 inches long is sufficient to hold one spell. The sheet is reinforced at the top and bottom with strips of leather slightly longer than the sheet is wide. A scroll holding more than one spell has the same width (about 8-1/2 inches) but is an extra foot or so long for each additional spell. Scrolls that hold three or more spells are usually fitted with reinforcing rods at each end rather than simple strips of leather. A scroll has AC 9, 1 hit point, hardness 0, and a break DC of 8.</p>
				<p>To protect it from wrinkling or tearing, a scroll is rolled up from both ends to form a double cylinder. (This also helps the user unroll the scroll quickly.) The scroll is placed in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood. Most scroll cases are inscribed with magic symbols which often identify the owner or the spells stored on the scrolls inside. The symbols sometimes hide magic traps.</p>
				<p><b>Activation:</b> To activate a scroll, a spellcaster must read the spell written on it. This involves several steps and conditions.</p>
				<p><i>Decipher the Writing:</i> The writing on a scroll must be deciphered before a character can use it or know exactly what spell it contains. This requires a <i>read magic</i> spell or a successful Spellcraft check (DC 20 + spell level). Deciphering a scroll is a full-round action.</p>
				<p>Deciphering a scroll to determine its contents does not activate its magic unless it is a specially prepared cursed scroll. A character can decipher the writing on a scroll in advance so that she can proceed directly to the next step when the time comes to use the scroll.</p>
				<p><i>Activate the Spell:</i> Activating a scroll requires reading the spell from the scroll. The character must be able to see and read the writing on the scroll. Activating a scroll spell requires no material components or focus. (The creator of the scroll provided these when scribing the scroll.) Note that some spells are effective only when cast on an item or items. In such a case, the scroll user must provide the item when activating the spell. Activating a scroll spell is subject to disruption just as casting a normally prepared spell would be. Using a scroll is like casting a spell for purposes of arcane spell failure chance.</p>
				<p>To have any chance of activating a scroll spell, the scroll user must meet the following requirements.</p>
				<list>
					<li>The spell must be of the correct type (arcane or divine). Arcane spellcasters (wizards, sorcerers, and bards) can only use scrolls containing arcane spells, and divine spellcasters (clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers) can only use scrolls containing divine spells. (The type of scroll a character creates is also determined by his class.)</li>
					<li>The user must have the spell on her class list.</li>
					<li>The user must have the requisite ability score.</li>
				</list>
				<p>If the user meets all the requirements noted above, and her caster level is at least equal to the spell's caster level, she can automatically activate the spell without a check. If she meets all three requirements but her own caster level is lower than the scroll spell's caster level, then she has to make a caster level check (DC = scroll's caster level + 1) to cast the spell successfully. If she fails, she must make a DC 5 Wisdom check to avoid a scroll mishap. A natural roll of 1 always fails, whatever the modifiers. Activating a scroll is a standard action (or the spell's casting time, whichever is longer) and it provokes attacks of opportunity exactly as casting a spell does. If the caster level check fails but no mishap occurs, the scroll is not expended.</p>
				<p><i>Determine Effect:</i> A spell successfully activated from a scroll works exactly like a spell prepared and cast the normal way. Assume the scroll spell's caster level is always the minimum level required to cast the spell for the character who scribed the scroll, unless the scriber specifically desired otherwise.</p>
				<p>The writing for an activated spell disappears from the scroll as the spell is cast.</p>
				<p><i>Scroll Mishaps:</i> When a mishap occurs, the spell on the scroll has a reversed or harmful effect. Possible mishaps are given below.</p>
				<list>
					<li>A surge of uncontrolled magical energy deals 1d6 points of damage per spell level to the scroll user.</li>
					<li>Spell strikes the scroll user or an ally instead of the intended target, or a random target nearby if the scroll user was the intended recipient.</li>
					<li>Spell takes effect at some random location within spell range.</li>
					<li>Spell's effect on the target is contrary to the spell's normal effect.</li>
					<li>The scroll user suffers some minor but bizarre effect related to the spell in some way. Most such effects should last only as long as the original spell's duration, or 2d10 minutes for instantaneous spells.</li>
					<li>Some innocuous item or items appear in the spell's area.</li>
					<li>Spell has delayed effect. Sometime within the next 1d12 hours, the spell activates. If the scroll user was the intended recipient, the spell takes effect normally. If the user was not the intended recipient, the spell goes off in the general direction of the original recipient or target, up to the spell's maximum range, if the target has moved away.</li>
				</list>
				<p>Note that some spells appear at different levels for different casters. The level of such spells depends on the caster scribing the scroll.</p>

			<description type="formattedtext">
				<p>In general, magic armor protects the wearer to a greater extent than non-magical armor. Magic armor bonuses are enhancement bonuses, never rise above +5, and stack with regular armor bonuses (and with shield and magic shield enhancement bonuses). All magic armor is also masterwork armor, reducing armor check penalties by 1.</p>
				<p>In addition to an enhancement bonus, armor may have special abilities. Special abilities usually count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of an item, but do not improve AC. A suit of armor cannot have an effective bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents, including those from character abilities and spells) higher than +10. A suit of armor with a special ability must also have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.</p>
				<p>A suit of armor or a shield may be made of an unusual material. Roll d% (percent dice) to determine if it is special or standard material: A roll of 01-95 indicates that the item is made of standard materials, a roll of 96-100 indicates that it is made of a special material.</p>
				<p>Armor is always created so that if the type of armor comes with a pair of boots, a helm, or a set of gauntlets, these pieces can be switched for other magic boots, helms, or gauntlets.</p>
				<p><b>Caster Level for Armor and Shields:</b> The caster level of a magic shield or magic armor with a special ability is given in the item Description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.</p>
				<p><b>Shields:</b> The caster level of a magic shield or magic armor with a special ability is given in the item Description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.</p>
				<p>A shield could be built that also acted as a magic weapon, but the cost of the enhancement bonus on attack rolls would need to be added into the cost of the shield and its enhancement bonus to AC.</p>
				<p>As with armor, special abilities built into the shield add to the market value in the form of additions to the bonus of the shield, although they do not improve AC. A shield cannot have an effective bonus (enhancement plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A shield with a special ability must also have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.</p>
				<p><b>Activation:</b> Usually a character benefits from magic armor and shields in exactly the way a character benefits from nonmagical armor and shields: by wearing them. If armor or a shield has a special ability that the user needs to activate, then the user usually needs to utter the command word (a standard action).</p>
				<p><b>Armor for Unusual Creatures:</b> The cost of armor for non-humanoid creatures, as well as for creatures who are neither Small nor Medium, varies (see Equipment). The cost of the masterwork quality and any magical enhancement remains the same.</p>
				<p>Most magic armor and shields only have enhancement bonuses. Such items can also have one or more of the special abilities detailed below:</p>

		<staff>
			<name type="string">Staffs</name>
			<description type="formattedtext">
				<p>A staff is a long shaft that stores several spells. Staves usually hold spells grouped by a theme, and sometimes possess other abilities that they grant to the wielder. A staff has 10 charges when created, but can be recharged by a spellcaster with the appropriate spells.</p>
				<p><b>Physical Description:</b> A typical staff measures anywhere from 4 feet to 7 feet long and is 2 inches to 3 inches thick, weighing about 5 pounds. Most staves are wood, but an exotic few are bone, metal, or even glass. A staff often has a gem or some device at its tip or is shod in metal at one or both ends. Staves are often decorated with carvings or runes. A typical staff also functions as a walking stick, quarterstaff, or cudgel. It has AC 7, 10 hit points, hardness 5, and a break DC of 24.</p>
				<p><b>Activation:</b> Staves use the spell trigger activation method, so casting a spell from a staff is usually a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. If the spell being cast has a longer casting time than 1 standard action, however, it takes the full casting time to cast the spell from a staff. To activate a staff, a character must hold it forth in at least one hand (or whatever passes for a hand, for nonhumanoid creatures).</p>
				<p><b>Special Qualities:</b> Roll d%. A 01-30 result indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides some clue to the staff 's function, and 31-100 indicates that it has no special qualities.</p>
				<p><b>Using Staves:</b> Staves use the wielder's ability score and relevant feats to set the DC for saves against their spells. Unlike with other sorts of magic items, the wielder can use his caster level when activating the power of the staff if it's higher than the caster level of the staff. This means that staves are far more potent in the hands of a powerful spellcaster. Because they use the wielder's ability score to set the save DC for the spells, spells from a staff are often harder to resist than those from other magic items, which use the minimum ability score required to cast the spell. Not only are aspects of the spell dependent on caster level (range, duration, and so on) potentially higher, but spells from a staff are also harder to dispel and have a better chance of overcoming spell resistance.</p>
				<p><b>Recharging Staves:</b> Staves hold a maximum of 10 charges. Each spell cast from a staff consumes one or more charges. When a staff runs out of charges, it cannot be used until it is recharged. Each morning, when a spellcaster prepares spells or regains spell slots, he can also imbue one staff with a portion of his power so long as one or more of the spells cast by the staff is on his spell list and he is capable of casting at least one of the spells. Imbuing a staff with this power restores one charge to the staff, but the caster must forgo one prepared spell or spell slot of a level equal to the highest-level spell cast by the staff. For example, a 9th-level wizard with a staff of fire could imbue the staff with one charge per day by using up one of his 4th-level spells. A staff cannot gain more than one charge per day and a caster cannot imbue more than one staff per day.</p>
				<p>A staff can hold spells of any level, and the minimum caster level of a staff is 8th.</p>

			<description type="formattedtext">
				<p>A wand is a thin baton that contains a single spell of 4th level or lower. A wand has 50 charges when created-each charge allows the use of the wand's spell one time. A wand that runs out of charges is just a stick.</p>
				<p><b>Physical Description:</b> A wand is 6 to 12 inches long, 1/4 inch thick, and weighs no more than 1 ounce. Most wands are wood, but some are bone, metal, or even crystal. A typical wand has Armor Class 7, 5 hit points, hardness 5, and a break DC of 16.</p>
				<p><b>Activation:</b> Wands use the spell trigger activation method, so casting a spell from a wand is usually a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. (If the spell being cast has a longer casting time than 1 action, however, it takes that long to cast the spell from a wand.) To activate a wand, a character must hold it in hand (or whatever passes for a hand, for non-humanoid creatures) and point it in the general direction of the target or area. A wand may be used while grappling or while swallowed whole.</p>
				<p><b>Special Qualities:</b> Roll d%. A 01-30 result indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides some clue to the wand's function, and 31-100 indicates no special qualities.</p>
				<p>Note that some spells appear at different levels for different casters. The level of such spells depends on the caster crafting the wand.</p>

			<name type="string">Weapons</name>
			<description type="formattedtext">
				<p>A magic weapon is enhanced to strike more truly and deliver more damage. Magic weapons have enhancement bonuses ranging from +1 to +5. They apply these bonuses to both attack and damage rolls when used in combat. All magic weapons are also masterwork weapons, but their masterwork bonuses on attack rolls do not stack with their enhancement bonuses on attack rolls.</p>
				<p>Weapons come in two basic categories: melee and ranged. Some of the weapons listed as melee weapons can also be used as ranged weapons. In this case, their enhancement bonuses apply to both melee and ranged attacks.</p>
				<p>ISome magic weapons have special abilities. Special abilities count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of the item, but do not modify attack or damage bonuses (except where specifically noted). A single weapon cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents, including those from character abilities and spells) higher than +10. A weapon with a special ability must also have at least a +1 enhancement bonus. Weapons cannot possess the same special ability more than once.</p>
				<p><b>Special Materials:</b> Weapons or ammunition can be made of an unusual material. Roll d%: 01-95 indicates that the item is of a standard sort, and 96-100 indicates that it is made of a special material.</p>
				<p><b>Caster Level for Weapons:</b> The caster level of a weapon with a special ability is given in the item description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus and no other abilities, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.</p>
				<p><b>Additional Damage Dice:</b> Some magic weapons deal additional dice of damage. Unlike other modifiers to damage, additional dice of damage are not multiplied when the attacker scores a critical hit.</p>
				<p><b>Ranged Weapons and Ammunition:</b> The enhancement bonus from a ranged weapon does not stack with the enhancement bonus from ammunition. Only the higher of the two enhancement bonuses applies.</p>
				<p>Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Similarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an alignment gains the alignment of that projectile weapon.</p>
				<p><b>Magic Ammunition and Breakage:</b> When a magic arrow, crossbow bolt, or sling bullet misses its target, there is a 50% chance it breaks or is otherwise rendered useless. A magic arrow, bolt, or bullet that successfully hits a target is automatically destroyed after it delivers its damage.</p>
				<p><b>Light Generation:</b> Fully 30% of magic weapons shed light equivalent to a light spell. These glowing weapons are quite obviously magical. Such a weapon can't be concealed when drawn, nor can its light be shut off. Some of the specific weapons detailed below always or never glow, as defined in their descriptions.</p>
				<p><b>Hardness and Hit Points:</b> Each +1 of a magic weapon's enhancement bonus adds +2 to its hardness and +10 to its hit points.</p>
				<p><b>Activation:</b> Usually a character benefits from a magic weapon in the same way a character benefits from a mundane weapon-by wielding (attacking with) it. If a weapon has a special ability that the user needs to activate, then the user usually needs to utter a command word (a standard action). A character can activate the special abilities of 50 pieces of ammunition at the same time, assuming each piece has identical abilities.</p>
				<p><b>Magic Weapons and Critical Hits:</b> Some weapon qualities and some specific weapons have an extra effect on a critical hit. This special effect also functions against creatures not normally subject to critical hits. On a successful critical roll, apply the special effect, but do not multiply the weapon's regular damage.</p>
				<p><b>Weapons for Unusually Sized Creatures:</b> The cost of weapons for creatures who are neither Small nor Medium varies (see Equipment). The cost of the masterwork quality and any magical enhancement remains the same.</p>
				<p><b>Special Qualities:</b> Roll d%. A 01-30 result indicates that the item sheds light, 31-45 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to the weapons function, and 46-100 indicates no special qualities.</p>

				<p>Wondrous Items is a catch all category for anything that doesn't fall into the other groups. Anyone can use a wondrous item (unless specified otherwise in the description).</p>
				<p><b>Activation:</b> Usually use-activated or command word, but details vary from item to item.</p>
				<p><b>Special Qualities:</b> oll d%. An 01 result indicates the wondrous item is intelligent, 02-31 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32-100 indicates no special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes (see Intelligent Items).</p>
				<p>Wondrous items with charges can never be intelligent.</p>
